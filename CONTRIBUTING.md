# Contributing to Kidzode 🚀

We're thrilled that you want to help kids grow their logical skills through coding! Kidzode is built for young minds, so we have some specific guidelines to keep our platform safe, fun, and educational.

## Our Philosophy
1. **Logic First**: We don't just teach syntax. We teach how to think.
2. **Kid-Centric**: Every lesson and UI element must be intuitive for a child.
3. **No Passive Learning**: We prioritize "doing" over "watching".

## How to Contribute
- **Lessons**: Add or improve courses in `public/courses`. Ensure tone is encouraging and content is age-appropriate.
- **Features**: Help us improve the interactive terminal and visual feedback systems.
- **Bug Fixes**: Help us keep the platform rock-solid (especially the Pyodide runtime).

## Contribution Rules
- **Tone**: Be encouraging, never condescending.
- **Safety**: No external links in lessons that lead away from safe educational spaces.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, documented code in TypeScript/React.
- **Tests**: If you're adding lesson logic, add tests in the `book.json` schema.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repo.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run locally: `npm run dev`.
4. Create a PR with a clear description of your changes.

Thank you for being part of the mission to build the next generation of logical thinkers! 🧠✨
