# Kidzode 🚀

**Building the next generation of logical thinkers through the power of Python.**

Kidzode is an interactive learning platform designed for kids to bridge the gap between abstract logic and real-world creation. We don't just teach code; we teach how to solve problems, think structurally, and build tools.

## 🧠 Why Kidzode?
- **Logic-First Curriculum**: Lessons structured to develop thinking patterns, not just syntax memorization.
- **Outcome-Oriented**: Transition from "What is Python?" to "I built a tool that solves this problem."
- **Fast & Reliable**: Main-thread Pyodide execution for instant coding feedback.
- **Premium Design**: A bold, high-contrast Neo-Brutalist UI that keeps kids engaged.

## 📚 Curriculum Structure
Our curriculum is divided into 6 Courses, taking students from "Hello World" to "Game Developer".

### Completed Courses (Available Now)
- **Course 1: Foundation (Basics)** - 8 Projects (Variables, Loops, Logic)
- **Course 2: Think Like an Engineer** - 8 Projects (Systems, Data, Tools)
- **Course 3: Data Scientist** - 8 Projects (Data Analysis, Chatbots)
- **Course 4: API Architect** - 8 Projects (Backend Logic, Databases)
- **Course 5: The App Master** - 8 Projects (OOP, Game Engines, Systems)

### Upcoming

## 🛠️ Development Workflow
We use a `Makefile` to simplify common development tasks.

### Quick Start
1. **Setup Project**: `make setup`
2. **Start Dev Server**: `make dev-local`
3. **Run Everything (Docker)**: `make dev`
