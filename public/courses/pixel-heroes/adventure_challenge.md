# Create Your Own Adventure Challenge

Amazing, Personal Story Creator! You've mastered adventure stories!
Now it's time for the ultimate challenge!
Can you create your OWN complete adventure story from scratch?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Write your own original adventure story with at least 3 choices!

## 📚 Before You Start
You know how to use variables, nested if/else, and create multiple endings.

## Your Challenge!
Create a story with:
1. A character name (ask the user)
2. At least 3 different choices
3. At least 4 different endings
4. Use the character's name throughout

```python
print("=== YOUR ADVENTURE TITLE HERE ===")
print()

# Get character info
hero_name = input("What is your character's name? ")

# YOUR STORY STARTS HERE!
# HINT: Start with a description of where they are
# HINT: Give them a first choice

print()
print(f"Welcome to the adventure, {hero_name}!")

# YOUR TURN! Create your story here
# Remember to use:
# - if/else for choices
# - Nested if/else for more choices
# - f-strings to use {hero_name}
# - Different endings (good, bad, funny, scary!)

# Example structure:
# choice1 = input("First choice? ")
# if choice1 == "option1":
#     choice2 = input("Second choice? ")
#     if choice2 == "option1":
#         print("Ending 1")
#     else:
#         print("Ending 2")
# else:
#     choice3 = input("Third choice? ")
#     if choice3 == "option1":
#         print("Ending 3")
#     else:
#         print("Ending 4")

print()
print("THE END!")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
You created a complete adventure story from your imagination!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- Plan your story before coding (draw a map of choices!)
- Each choice should lead somewhere interesting
- Mix happy and sad endings to make it exciting
- Test all paths to make sure they work!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
- Add 5 or more choices for a longer story
- Create a mystery story where you solve a crime
- Make a space adventure or underwater quest
- Add items the player can collect
- Create a scoring system

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Too complex?** Start simple with 2 choices, then add more
- **Lost track?** Draw your story as a tree diagram on paper first
- **Need ideas?** Think about your favorite movie or book
- **Indentation errors?** Make sure each nested if is indented properly
