# Challenge: Create Your Own Adventure

Write your own adventure story with at least 3 choices!

## What to Do
Create a story with:
1. A character name (ask the user)
2. At least 3 different choices
3. At least 4 different endings
4. Use the character's name throughout

```python
print("=== YOUR ADVENTURE TITLE HERE ===")
print()

# Get character info
hero_name = input("What is your character's name? ")

# YOUR STORY STARTS HERE!
# HINT: Start with a description of where they are
# HINT: Give them a first choice

print()
print(f"Welcome to the adventure, {hero_name}!")

# YOUR TURN! Create your story here
# Remember to use:
# - if/else for choices
# - Nested if/else for more choices
# - f-strings to use {hero_name}
# - Different endings (good, bad, funny, scary!)

# Example structure:
# choice1 = input("First choice? ")
# if choice1 == "option1":
#     choice2 = input("Second choice? ")
#     if choice2 == "option1":
#         print("Ending 1")
#     else:
#         print("Ending 2")
# else:
#     choice3 = input("Third choice? ")
#     if choice3 == "option1":
#         print("Ending 3")
#     else:
#         print("Ending 4")

print()
print("THE END!")
```

## Remember
- Plan your story before coding
- Each choice should lead somewhere interesting
- Mix happy and sad endings
- Test all paths!

## Try This
Add more choices or create a mystery story!

## If Stuck
- Start simple with 2 choices
- Draw your story on paper first
- Check indentation for nested ifs
