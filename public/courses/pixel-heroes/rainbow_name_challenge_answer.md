# Answer

Here's the complete solution:

```python
my_name = "Rose"
friend_name = "Jack"

print("* * * * * * * * * *")
print("Hello, " + my_name + "!")
print("Hello, " + friend_name + "!")
print("You are both AMAZING!")
print("* * * * * * * * * *")
```

**Remember:** Try solving it yourself first! Understanding how it works is more important than just copying the answer. Change the names to yours and your friend's name!
