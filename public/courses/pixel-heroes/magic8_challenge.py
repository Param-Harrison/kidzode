# Challenge: Fortune Categories
#
# Your task: Create three lists and use if/elif/else to pick from the right one!
#
# Step 1: Import the random module
# Example: import random
#
# Step 2: Create three lists for different fortune types
# Example:
# yes_fortunes = ["Yes, definitely!", "Absolutely!", "The stars say yes!"]
# no_fortunes = ["No way!", "Don't count on it!", "Not a chance!"]
# maybe_fortunes = ["Maybe later!", "Ask again tomorrow!", "Cannot predict now!"]
#
# Step 3: Ask the user what type of answer they want
# Example:
# print("What type of answer do you want?")
# answer_type = input("Type 'yes', 'no', or 'maybe': ")
#
# Step 4: Ask their question
# Example: question = input("Now ask your yes/no question: ")
#
# Step 5: Use if/elif/else to pick from the right list
# Example:
# if answer_type == "yes":
#     print(random.choice(yes_fortunes))
# elif answer_type == "no":
#     print(random.choice(no_fortunes))
# else:
#     print(random.choice(maybe_fortunes))
#
# Step 6: Print the result
# Example: print("The Magic 8-Ball says...")
