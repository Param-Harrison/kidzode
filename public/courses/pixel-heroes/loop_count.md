# Count with Loops

Make Python count numbers!

## What to Do
1. Press Run
2. See Python count up and down!

```python
# Count from 1 to 10
print("Counting up:")
for number in range(1, 11):
    print(number)

# Count from 10 down to 1
print("Counting down:")
for number in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(number)

print("BLAST OFF!")
```

## Remember
- `range(1, 11)` counts 1 to 10
- `range(10, 0, -1)` counts backwards
- Use the number inside the loop!

## Try This
Count by 2s: `range(0, 11, 2)`

## If Stuck
- `range(1, 11)` stops before 11
- Use `-1` to count backwards

You did it! ⭐
