# Hints

You need to check what the user typed and pick from the right list. Use `if` statements to check!

---

Check if `answer_type == "yes"`. If it is, use `random.choice(yes_fortunes)` to pick a fortune from the yes list.

---

Use `elif` to check for "no" and "maybe" too! `elif answer_type == "no":` then pick from `no_fortunes`.

---

Don't forget to print the answer! After picking from the right list, save it in a variable and print it.
