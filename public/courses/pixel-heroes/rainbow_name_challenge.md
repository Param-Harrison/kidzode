# Challenge: Add Your Friend's Name

Time for a challenge! Greet TWO people with stars around their names.

Change `Rose` to YOUR name and `Jack` to your friend's name. Press Run and see both names appear!

```python
my_name = "Rose"
friend_name = "Jack"

print("* * * * * * * * * *")
print("Hello, " + my_name + "!")
print("Hello, " + friend_name + "!")
print("You are both AMAZING!")
print("* * * * * * * * * *")
```

**Tip:** You can make as many variables as you want! Just give each one a different name. Use underscores `_` instead of spaces (like `friend_name` not `friend name`).

Want to make it harder? Add a third person or try using `+` or `=` instead of stars!
