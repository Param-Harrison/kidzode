# Add Your Friend's Name Challenge

You're becoming a real Pixel Hero master!
You can make your own name look amazing with stars and patterns.
But can you make it work for TWO people at once?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Make the program greet both you AND your friend with stars!

## 📚 Before You Start
You know how to create variables and use them in `print()` statements.

## Let's Do It!
1. Change Rose to YOUR name
2. Change Jack to your FRIEND'S name
3. Press the green **Run** button
4. See both names appear!

```python
my_name = "Rose"
friend_name = "Jack"

print("* * * * * * * * * *")
print("Hello, " + my_name + "!")
print("Hello, " + friend_name + "!")
print("You are both AMAZING!")
print("* * * * * * * * * *")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
Both names appear with stars around them!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- You can create as many variables as you need
- Each variable needs a different name (like `my_name` and `friend_name`)
- Variable names can have underscores (`_`) but no spaces
- You can use multiple variables in the same program

## 🎨 Try This Next!
- Add a third person: `other_friend = "Emma"`
- Add more star lines to make a bigger box
- Try using different symbols like `+` or `=`

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Error: name is not defined?** Make sure you created both variables at the top
- **Names look the same?** Check that you changed both `"Rose"` and `"Jack"` to different names
- **Weird output?** Make sure you're using the right variable names in your `print()` statements

## 🌟 Show Your Parents!
"Look! I can make a program that remembers multiple people's names and uses them all!"

You just unlocked the **Multi-Memory Master** superpower! ⭐

**CHALLENGE COMPLETE!** You've finished Project 1! 🎉
