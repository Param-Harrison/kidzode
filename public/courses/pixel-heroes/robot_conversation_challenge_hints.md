# Hints

You already have one question for the name. Now you need to add a second question for age!

---

Use `input()` again to ask for age, just like you did for name. Save it in a variable called `age`.

---

After asking the age question, use both `name` and `age` in your print statements. Remember to use `+` to glue text together!

---

Here's the pattern: `age = input("How old are you? ")` asks the question and saves the answer. Then use `age` in your print statement!
