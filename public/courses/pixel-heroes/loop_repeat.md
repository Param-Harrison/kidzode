# Repeat Yourself with Loops!

Welcome, Magic 8-Ball Master! You've learned so much!
But typing the same thing over and over is BORING!
What if Python could repeat things for you automatically?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Learn to make Python repeat actions using loops!

## Let's Do It!
1. Read the code - see how loops work!
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Watch Python repeat automatically!

```python
# Print "Hello!" 5 times
print("=== LOOP MAGIC ===")
print()

for i in range(5):
    print("Hello!")

print()
print("Done! That was easy!")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
Python printed "Hello!" 5 times with just 2 lines of code!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- `for i in range(5):` means "repeat 5 times"
- Everything indented (moved right) gets repeated
- `range(5)` creates numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- The `:` at the end is VERY important!

## 🔮 Try to Predict!
Before running, guess: How many times will "Hello!" print?
Answer: 5 times!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Change `range(5)` to `range(10)` - what happens?

## 🤔 Common Mistakes
**Mistake 1**: Forgetting the colon `:`
```python
for i in range(5)  # ❌ Missing :
    print("Hello!")
```
**Fix**: Always add `:` after the for line!

**Mistake 2**: Forgetting to indent
```python
for i in range(5):
print("Hello!")  # ❌ Not indented
```
**Fix**: Press Tab or add 4 spaces before `print`!

## 📝 Self-Check Quiz
1. What does `range(5)` mean?
2. What happens to code that's indented under `for`?
3. What's the symbol at the end of the `for` line?
