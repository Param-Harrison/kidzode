# Repeat with Loops

Make Python repeat things automatically!

## What to Do
1. Press Run
2. See "Hello!" print 5 times!

```python
# Print "Hello!" 5 times
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello!")

print("Done!")
```

## Remember
- `for i in range(5):` means repeat 5 times
- Indented code gets repeated
- Don't forget the `:` at the end!

## Try This
Change `range(5)` to `range(10)`

## If Stuck
- Add `:` after `range(5)`
- Indent code inside the loop

You did it! ⭐
