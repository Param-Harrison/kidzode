# Repeat with Loops

Tired of typing the same thing over and over? Loops do it for you! Press Run and watch "Hello!" print 5 times automatically.

```python
# Print "Hello!" 5 times
for i in range(5):
    print("Hello!")

print("Done!")
```

**How it works:** `for i in range(5):` means "repeat 5 times". Everything indented inside gets repeated. Don't forget the `:` at the end!

Try changing `range(5)` to `range(10)` - now it prints 10 times!
