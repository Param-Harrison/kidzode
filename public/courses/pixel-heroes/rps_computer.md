# Computer Makes a Choice

Welcome, Professional Security Tool Creator! You've built amazing tools!
Now let's create a GAME - Rock-Paper-Scissors!
Can you make the computer choose rock, paper, or scissors randomly?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Make the computer randomly choose rock, paper, or scissors!

## Let's Do It!
1. Read the code - see the computer choosing!
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Run it many times to see different choices!

```python
import random

print("=== ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS ===")
print()

# Computer makes a random choice
choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
computer_choice = random.choice(choices)

print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
The computer picks a different choice each time - just like a real player!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- We use a list with three options: rock, paper, scissors
- `random.choice(choices)` picks one randomly
- Each time you run it, the computer might choose differently
- This is how games make random decisions!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Add more options! Try "lizard" and "spock" for Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock!

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Same choice every time?** That's just luck - keep running it!
- **Error: random not defined?** Make sure you have `import random`
- **Want to see all choices?** Run the program 10 times!
