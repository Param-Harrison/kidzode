# Answer

Here's the complete solution:

```python
print("Hi! I'm Super Robot!")

name = input("What's your name? ")

age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Hello, " + name + "! It's nice to meet you!")
print("Wow, " + age + " is a great age, " + name + "!")
```

**Remember:** Try solving it yourself first! Understanding how variables work is more important than just copying the answer. You can add more questions too!
