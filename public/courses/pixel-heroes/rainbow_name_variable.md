# Put Your Name on a Magic Name Tag

Great job, Pixel Hero! Your giant name looks awesome!
But what if you want to use your name in many places?
A true Pixel Hero knows how to put their name on a magic name tag!

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Learn to store your name in a memory box so you can use it many times!

## 📚 Before You Start
You already know how to use `print()` to show text on the screen.

## Let's Do It!
1. Change Rose to YOUR name (you can use normal letters now)
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Watch your name appear twice!

```python
name = "Rose"

print("Hello, " + name + "!")
print("You are amazing, " + name + "!")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
Your name appears twice, but you only typed it once!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- `name = "Rose"` creates a memory box called `name`
- The `=` sign puts your name into the memory box
- Use `name` (without quotes) to get your name back
- The `+` sign glues text together

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Try adding a third line: `print("Goodbye, " + name + "!")`

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Error: name is not defined?** Make sure you have the line `name = "Rose"` at the top
- **Name doesn't change?** Make sure you changed `"Rose"` to your name inside the quotes
- **Weird symbols?** Make sure you use `+` to connect text pieces

## 🌟 Show Your Parents!
"Look! I learned about variables - they're like memory boxes that remember things!"

You just unlocked the **Memory Box** superpower! ⭐
