# Save Your Name

Store your name once, use it many times!

## What to Do
1. Change Rose to YOUR name
2. Press Run
3. See your name appear twice!

```python
name = "Rose"

print("Hello, " + name + "!")
print("You are amazing, " + name + "!")
```

## Remember
- `name = "Rose"` saves your name
- Use `name` to get it back
- `+` glues text together

## Try This
Add: `print("Goodbye, " + name + "!")`

## If Stuck
- Make sure `name = "Rose"` is at the top
- Change `"Rose"` to your name
- Use `+` between text pieces

You did it! ⭐
