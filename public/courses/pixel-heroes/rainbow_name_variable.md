# Save Your Name

Instead of typing your name over and over, save it once and use it everywhere!

Change `Rose` to YOUR name, then press Run. See how your name appears twice without typing it twice?

```python
name = "Rose"

print("Hello, " + name + "!")
print("You are amazing, " + name + "!")
```

**How it works:** `name = "Rose"` saves your name in a box called `name`. Then you can use `name` anywhere and Python remembers it! The `+` glues text together.

Try adding another line: `print("Goodbye, " + name + "!")`
