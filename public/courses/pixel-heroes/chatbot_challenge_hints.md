# Hints

Instead of checking exact matches with `==`, use `in` to check if a word appears anywhere! `"sad" in user_input` checks if "sad" is anywhere in what they typed.

---

Check for multiple keywords using `or`: `if "sad" in user_input or "unhappy" in user_input:`. This catches different ways of saying the same thing!

---

Respond with empathy! If they're sad, say something comforting. If they're happy, celebrate with them! Use their name in your response.

---

You can check for multiple emotions: sad, happy, excited, angry. Use `elif` to check each one and give appropriate responses!
