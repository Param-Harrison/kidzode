# Add Rocket to Your Countdown

Great job, Countdown Master! Your countdown works perfectly!
But let's make it look more like a real rocket launch!
Can you add a rocket and make it more exciting?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Add a rocket and better formatting to your countdown!

## 📚 Before You Start
You know how to use `range()` to count backwards from 10 to 1.

## Let's Do It!
1. Read the code - see the rocket and formatting!
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Watch the exciting countdown!

```python
print("=== ROCKET LAUNCH SEQUENCE ===")
print()

# Countdown from 10 to 1
for number in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(f"T-minus {number}...")

print()
print("BLAST OFF! 🚀")
print("The rocket is launching!")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
Your countdown looks like a real NASA launch sequence!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- `print()` with nothing inside creates a blank line
- `f"T-minus {number}..."` puts the number inside the text
- The `f` before the quotes makes it a "format string"
- You can combine text and variables easily this way!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Add more lines after BLAST OFF like "Stage 1 complete!" or "Entering orbit!"

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **No rocket emoji?** That's okay, it might not show in all systems
- **Error with f-string?** Make sure you have `f` before the opening quote
- **Number not showing?** Check that you have `{number}` inside the string

## 🌟 Show Your Parents!
"Look! My countdown looks like a real NASA rocket launch!"

You just unlocked the **Rocket Scientist** superpower! ⭐
