# Add Rocket

Make your countdown look like a real rocket launch!

## What to Do
1. Press Run
2. See the rocket launch!

```python
print("=== ROCKET LAUNCH SEQUENCE ===")
print()

# Countdown from 10 to 1
for number in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(f"T-minus {number}...")

print()
print("BLAST OFF! 🚀")
print("The rocket is launching!")
```

## Remember
- `print()` with nothing makes a blank line
- `f"T-minus {number}..."` puts number in text
- The `f` makes it a format string

## Try This
Add more lines after BLAST OFF!

## If Stuck
- Make sure you have `f` before quotes
- Check `{number}` is inside the string

You did it! ⭐
