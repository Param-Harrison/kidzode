# Get Letters from Words

Grab individual letters from words!

## What to Do
1. Press Run
2. See how to get letters!

```python
word = "PYTHON"

# Get letters by position
print(f"First letter: {word[0]}")
print(f"Second letter: {word[1]}")
print(f"Last letter: {word[5]}")

# Make initials
first_name = "Rose"
last_name = "Smith"
initials = first_name[0] + last_name[0]
print(f"Initials: {initials}")

- Letters start at 0 (not 1!)
- `word[0]` is the first letter
- `word[1]` is the second letter

- First letter is always [0]
- Count carefully!
