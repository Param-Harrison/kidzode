# Make a Robot Talk

Make a robot that talks!

## What to Do
1. Press Run
2. See your robot talk!

```python
# Comments start with # - Python ignores them

print("Hello! I am a friendly robot!")
print("Beep boop! Nice to meet you!")
```

## Remember
- Comments start with `#`
- Each `print()` makes the robot say something new

## Try This
Change what the robot says!

## If Stuck
- Press the Run button
- Put all text in quotes

You did it! ⭐
