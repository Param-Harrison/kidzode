# Build Your First Talking Robot

You're a Rainbow Name Master! Now it's time to build something even cooler!
The Robot Factory needs your help to build your very first talking robot!
Are you ready to become a Robot Builder?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Make a robot that can talk and introduce itself!

## Let's Do It!
1. Read the code below
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Watch your robot come to life!

```python
# This is a comment - Python ignores it!
# Comments help us explain what our code does

# This makes our robot say hello
print("Hello! I am a friendly robot!")
print("Beep boop! Nice to meet you!")

# End of our robot program
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
Your robot talks to you with its own personality!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- Comments start with `#` - Python ignores them
- Comments help explain what your code does
- Each `print()` makes the robot say something new
- You can make your robot say anything you want!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Change what the robot says! Make it say YOUR favorite greeting!

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Nothing appears?** Make sure you pressed the green Run button
- **Error message?** Check that all your text is inside quotes: `"like this"`
- **Robot says weird things?** Make sure you only changed the text INSIDE the quotes
