# Make a Robot Talk

Let's build a robot that can talk! Press Run and watch it come to life.

```python
# Comments start with # - Python ignores them

print("Hello! I am a friendly robot!")
print("Beep boop! Nice to meet you!")
```

See those lines starting with `#`? Those are comments - Python ignores them, but they help us understand the code!

Each `print()` makes your robot say something new. Try changing what the robot says - make it funny or friendly!
