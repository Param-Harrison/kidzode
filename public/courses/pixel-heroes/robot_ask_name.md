# Teach Your Robot to Ask Questions

Your robot can talk, but it only says the same thing every time!
Let's make your robot smarter by teaching it to ask questions and listen to answers!
Time to level up your robot skills!

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Make your robot ask for your name and wait for your answer!

## 📚 Before You Start
You know how to make your robot talk using `print()` and comments with `#`.

## Let's Do It!
1. Press the green **Run** button
2. When the robot asks, type your name
3. Press **Enter** to continue

```python
# Our robot will ask for your name
print("Hi! I'm a friendly robot!")

# input() makes the robot ask a question and wait for your answer
input("What's your name? ")

# The robot says goodbye
print("Nice to meet you! Bye for now!")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
Your robot asks YOU a question and waits for YOUR answer!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- `input("text here")` shows text and waits for you to type
- The robot pauses until you type something and press Enter
- Always put the question text inside quote marks
- Right now the robot forgets your answer (we'll fix that next!)

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Change the question! Try `input("What's your favorite color? ")`

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Robot doesn't wait?** Make sure you used `input()` not `print()`
- **No question appears?** Check that your question is inside quotes
- **Error message?** Make sure you have the closing `)` after the quote marks

## 🌟 Show Your Parents!
"Look! My robot can ask me questions and wait for my answers!"
