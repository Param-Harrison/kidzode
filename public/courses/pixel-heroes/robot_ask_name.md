# Robot Asks Questions

Now let's make your robot ask questions! Press Run, then type your name when it asks.

```python
print("Hi! I'm a friendly robot!")

# input() asks a question and waits for your answer
input("What's your name? ")

print("Nice to meet you! Bye for now!")
```

**How it works:** `input()` shows text and waits for you to type something. Put your question inside quotes, and don't forget to press Enter after typing!

Try changing the question - ask about favorite color, age, or anything you want!
