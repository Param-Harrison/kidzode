# CHALLENGE: Make your robot ask TWO questions!
# Start with the robot greeting
print("Hi! I'm Super Robot!")

# Ask for the first question and store it
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Now add your second question here!
# HINT: age = input("How old are you? ")

# Use BOTH answers in the robot's conversation
print("Hello, " + name + "! It's nice to meet you!")

# Add more conversation using both name and age!
# HINT: print("Wow, " + age + " is a great age, " + name + "!")
