# Add Stars Around Your Name

Make your name look super cool with stars around it!

Change `Jack` to YOUR name, then press Run. Watch the stars appear!

```python
name = "Jack"

print("* * * * * * * * * *")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
print("You are a STAR!")
print("* * * * * * * * * *")
```

**Fun fact:** Stars are just `*` characters! Use `print()` many times to create patterns. Add spaces between stars to make them look nice.

Try changing the stars to `+ + + +` or `= = = =` for different looks!
