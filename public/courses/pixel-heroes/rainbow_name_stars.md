# Add Sparkling Stars Around Your Name

Awesome work, Pixel Hero! You've mastered the memory box!
Now let's make your name even MORE spectacular!
The Star Master wants you to add sparkling stars around your name!

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Add stars above and below your name to make it look super cool!

## 📚 Before You Start
You know how to store your name in a variable and use `print()` to show it.

## Let's Do It!
1. Change Jack to YOUR name
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. See the stars appear!

```python
name = "Jack"

print("* * * * * * * * * *")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
print("You are a STAR!")
print("* * * * * * * * * *")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
Your name is now surrounded by sparkling stars above and below!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- You can use `print()` multiple times to create patterns
- Stars (`*`) are just regular text characters
- Spaces between stars make them look sparkly
- The variable `name` works in any `print()` statement

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Try changing the stars to a different pattern like `+ + + +` or `= = = =`

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Stars look weird?** Make sure you have spaces between each `*` character
- **Name doesn't show?** Check that you have the `name = "Jack"` line at the top
- **Error message?** Make sure all your text is inside quotes

## 🌟 Show Your Parents!
"Look! I can make patterns with code and combine them with my name!"

You just unlocked the **Pattern Maker** superpower! ⭐
