# Add Stars Around Your Name

Make your name look cool with stars!

## What to Do
1. Change Jack to YOUR name
2. Press Run
3. See the stars!

```python
name = "Jack"

print("* * * * * * * * * *")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
print("You are a STAR!")
print("* * * * * * * * * *")
```

## Remember
- Use `print()` many times for patterns
- Stars are just `*` characters
- Add spaces between stars

## Try This
Change stars to `+ + + +` or `= = = =`

## If Stuck
- Add spaces between `*`
- Check `name = "Jack"` is at the top
- Put all text in quotes
