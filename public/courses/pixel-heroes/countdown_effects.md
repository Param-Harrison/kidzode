# Add Sound Effects

Make your rocket launch more exciting with sound effects! Press Run and hear the sounds!

```python
print("=== ROCKET LAUNCH SEQUENCE ===")
print("Engines starting... RUMBLE RUMBLE")
print()

# Countdown from 10 to 1
for number in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(f"T-minus {number}... BEEP!")

print()
print("BLAST OFF! WHOOOOSH!")
print("ROAR! The rocket is launching!")
print("BOOM! Stage 1 separation!")
print("ZOOM! Entering orbit!")
```

**Fun fact:** Sound effects make code fun! Add as many `print()` lines as you want - there's no limit!

Create your own sounds like "VROOM!", "KABOOM!", or "POW!" - make it your own!
