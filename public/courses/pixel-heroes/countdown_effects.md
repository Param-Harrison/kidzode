# Add Sound Effects

Add sound effects to make your rocket more exciting!

## What to Do
1. Press Run
2. Hear the sounds!

```python
print("=== ROCKET LAUNCH SEQUENCE ===")
print("Engines starting... RUMBLE RUMBLE")
print()

# Countdown from 10 to 1
for number in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(f"T-minus {number}... BEEP!")

print()
print("BLAST OFF! WHOOOOSH!")
print("ROAR! The rocket is launching!")
print("BOOM! Stage 1 separation!")
print("ZOOM! Entering orbit!")
```

## Remember
- Sound effects make code fun!
- Add as many `print()` lines as you want

## Try This
Create your own sounds like "VROOM!" or "KABOOM!"

## If Stuck
- Add more `print()` lines
- Change words to anything you like!

You did it! ⭐
