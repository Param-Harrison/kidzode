You know how to use f-strings to format text with variables.

## Let's Do It!
1. Read the code - see the sound effects!
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Feel the excitement!

```python
print("=== ROCKET LAUNCH SEQUENCE ===")
print("Engines starting... RUMBLE RUMBLE")
print()

# Countdown from 10 to 1
for number in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(f"T-minus {number}... BEEP!")

print()
print("BLAST OFF! WHOOOOSH!")
print("ROAR! The rocket is launching!")
print("BOOM! Stage 1 separation!")
print("ZOOM! Entering orbit!")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
Your rocket launch has sound effects - you can almost hear it!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- Sound effect words make code more fun and exciting
- You can add as many `print()` statements as you want
- Creative text makes your programs more interesting
- Real programmers add fun details like this!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Create your own sound effects! Try "VROOM!" or "KABOOM!" or "WHOMP!"

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Too many lines?** That's okay! More is more fun!
