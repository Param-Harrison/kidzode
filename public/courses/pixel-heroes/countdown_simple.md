# Rocket Launch Countdown

Welcome back, Pixel Hero! You've mastered drawing and fortunes!
Now it's time to build something EXCITING - a rocket launch countdown!
Can you make Python count down from 10 to BLAST OFF?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Create a countdown from 10 to 1, then BLAST OFF!

## Let's Do It!
1. Read the code below - see the `range()` counting backwards!
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Watch the countdown!

```python
# Countdown from 10 to 1
for number in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(number)

print("BLAST OFF!")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
The numbers count down automatically - 10, 9, 8... BLAST OFF!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- `range(10, 0, -1)` counts from 10 down to 1
- The `-1` means count backwards (down)
- `range(10, 0, -1)` does NOT include 0
- The loop runs 10 times automatically!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Try `range(5, 0, -1)` for a faster countdown from 5!

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Counting up instead of down?** Make sure you have `-1` at the end
- **Stops at 1?** That's correct! `range(10, 0, -1)` stops before 0
- **Want to include 0?** Use `range(10, -1, -1)` instead

## 🌟 Show Your Parents!
"Look! I made a rocket countdown that counts backwards automatically!"

You just unlocked the **Countdown Master** superpower! ⭐
