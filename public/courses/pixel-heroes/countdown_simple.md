# Rocket Countdown

Make a countdown from 10 to BLAST OFF!

## What to Do
1. Press Run
2. Watch the countdown!

```python
# Countdown from 10 to 1
for number in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(number)

print("BLAST OFF!")
```

## Remember
- `range(10, 0, -1)` counts from 10 down to 1
- The `-1` means count backwards
- Stops at 1 (not 0)

## Try This
Try `range(5, 0, -1)` for a faster countdown!

## If Stuck
- Make sure you have `-1` at the end
- It stops at 1, that's correct!

You did it! ⭐
