## 🎯 Today's Mission
Create a Magic 8-Ball that gives you a random fortune!

## Let's Do It!
1. Read the code below carefully
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Run it again and again - you'll get different fortunes!

```python
import random

# Create a list of possible fortunes
fortunes = ["Yes, definitely!", "No way!", "Maybe later!"]

answer = random.choice(fortunes)

# Show the fortune
print("The Magic 8-Ball says...")
print(answer)
```

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- `import random` gives you access to random powers
- Lists use square brackets `[]` and commas between items
- `random.choice(fortunes)` picks one item randomly from the list
- Each time you run the program, you might get a different answer!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Add your own fortune to the list! Try: `"Ask again tomorrow!"`

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Error: random is not defined?** Make sure you have `import random` at the very top
- **Same answer every time?** That's just luck! Keep running it
- **Error with brackets?** Make sure you use square brackets `[]` for lists
- **Fortunes not showing?** Check that each fortune is in quotes and separated by commas
