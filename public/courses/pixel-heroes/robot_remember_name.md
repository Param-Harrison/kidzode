# Robot Remembers Your Name

Now your robot can remember your name and use it! Press Run, type your name, and watch it use your name three times!

```python
print("Hi! I'm a friendly robot!")

# Save the answer in a variable
name = input("What's your name? ")

print("Hello, " + name + "! It's nice to meet you!")
print("I will remember your name, " + name + "!")
print("Goodbye, " + name + "! Come back soon!")
```

**The trick:** `name = input(...)` asks a question AND saves your answer! Then you can use `name` anywhere and Python remembers what you typed. Use `+` to glue text together.

Try adding another line that uses your name - make your robot say something fun!
