# Robot Remembers Your Name

Make your robot remember and use your name!

## What to Do
1. Press Run
2. Type your name when asked
3. See your name used 3 times!

```python
print("Hi! I'm a friendly robot!")

# Save the answer in a variable
name = input("What's your name? ")

print("Hello, " + name + "! It's nice to meet you!")
print("I will remember your name, " + name + "!")
print("Goodbye, " + name + "! Come back soon!")
```

## Remember
- `name = input(...)` asks AND saves the answer
- Use `name` to get it back
- Use `+` to glue text together

## Try This
Add another line using your name!

## If Stuck
- Make sure `name = input(...)` comes first
- Use `+ name +` to insert it

You did it! ⭐
