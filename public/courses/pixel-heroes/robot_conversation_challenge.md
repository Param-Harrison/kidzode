# Challenge: Robot Asks Two Questions

Challenge time! Make your robot ask TWO questions - one for name, one for age.

Add a second question for age, save it in a variable, then use both name and age in your messages!

```python
print("Hi! I'm Super Robot!")

name = input("What's your name? ")

# Add your second question here!
# HINT: age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Hello, " + name + "! It's nice to meet you!")

# Use both name and age!
# HINT: print("Wow, " + age + " is a great age, " + name + "!")
```

**Tip:** You can make as many variables as you want! Just give each one a different name. Use `+` to glue text together.
