# Challenge: Robot Asks Two Questions

Make your robot ask TWO questions!

## What to Do
1. Add a question for age
2. Save it in a variable
3. Use both name and age!

```python
print("Hi! I'm Super Robot!")

name = input("What's your name? ")

# Add your second question here!
# HINT: age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Hello, " + name + "! It's nice to meet you!")

# Use both name and age!
# HINT: print("Wow, " + age + " is a great age, " + name + "!")
```

## Remember
- You can make many variables
- Each needs a different name
- Use `+` to glue them together

## Try This
Add a third question!

## If Stuck
- Create `age` variable with `input()`
- Use `+ age +` in your print
