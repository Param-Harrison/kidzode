# Robot Conversation Challenge

Your robot is getting really smart! It can remember your name and have a conversation!
But the Robot Factory has one final challenge for you...
Can you make your robot ask TWO questions and remember BOTH answers?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Make the robot ask for your name AND your age, then use BOTH in the conversation!

## 📚 Before You Start
You know how to create multiple variables and use `input()` to ask questions.

## Your Challenge!
1. The robot should ask for your name (already done)
2. Add a second question to ask for your age
3. Create a memory box to store the age
4. Use BOTH name and age in the conversation!

```python
# Start with the robot greeting
print("Hi! I'm Super Robot!")

# Ask for the first question and store it
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Now add your second question here!
# HINT: age = input("How old are you? ")

# Use BOTH answers in the robot's conversation
print("Hello, " + name + "! It's nice to meet you!")

# Add more conversation using both name and age!
# HINT: print("Wow, " + age + " is a great age, " + name + "!")

```

## ✨ Magic Moment
Your robot has a real two-question conversation and remembers everything!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- You can create as many variables as you need
- Each variable needs a different name (like `name` and `age`)
- You can use multiple variables in the same `print()` statement
- Remember to use `+` to glue text and variables together

## 🎨 Try This Next!
- Add a third question (favorite color? favorite food?)
- Make the robot tell a joke using the person's name
- Add more personality to your robot's responses

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Error: age is not defined?** Make sure you created the `age` variable with `input()`
- **Age doesn't show?** Check that you're using `+ age +` in your print statement
- **Spacing looks weird?** Make sure you have spaces inside your quotes

## 🌟 Show Your Parents!
"Look! My robot can have a real conversation and remember multiple things about me!"

You just unlocked the **Super Conversation** superpower! ⭐

**CHALLENGE COMPLETE!** You've finished Project 2! 🎉
