# Hints

Create a weaknesses list just like the other lists! Use square brackets `[]` and put weaknesses inside quotes.

---

After creating the `weaknesses` list, use `random.choice(weaknesses)` to pick one randomly, just like you did for powers.

---

Save the weakness in a variable: `weakness = random.choice(weaknesses)`. Then print it using an f-string: `print(f"Weakness: {weakness}")`.

---

Make sure to print the weakness after printing the power! It should be part of the complete profile.
