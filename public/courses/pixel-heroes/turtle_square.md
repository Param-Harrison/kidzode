# Draw a Perfect Square with Turtle

Welcome back, Pixel Hero! You've mastered text and random fortunes!
Now it's time to learn DRAWING with code!
Can you make a turtle draw a perfect square on the screen?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Use Python's turtle to draw a perfect square!

## Let's Do It!
1. Read the code below
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Watch the turtle draw!

```python
import turtle

# Create a turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()

# Draw a square (4 sides)
t.forward(100)  # Move forward 100 steps
t.left(90)      # Turn left 90 degrees
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)
t.forward(100)
t.left(90)

# Keep the window open
turtle.done()
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
A perfect square appears on your screen, drawn by a turtle!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- `import turtle` gives you drawing powers
- `turtle.Turtle()` creates a turtle that can draw
- `forward(100)` moves the turtle forward 100 steps
- `left(90)` turns the turtle left 90 degrees
- A square has 4 equal sides and 4 right angles (90 degrees)

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Change `100` to `150` to make a bigger square!

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Nothing appears?** Make sure you have `turtle.done()` at the end
- **Turtle goes off screen?** Try smaller numbers like `50`
- **Not a square?** Check that all `forward()` numbers are the same
- **Error: turtle not found?** Make sure `import turtle` is at the top
