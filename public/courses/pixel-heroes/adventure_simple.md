# Your First Adventure Story

Welcome, Math Master! You've conquered times tables!
Now let's create something EPIC - your own adventure story!
Can you make a story where YOU choose what happens?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Create a simple story with two different paths!

## Let's Do It!
1. Read the story - see the two choices!
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Type "left" or "right" to choose your path!

```python
print("=== THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST ===")
print()
print("You are standing at the edge of a dark forest.")
print("There are two paths ahead of you.")
print()

choice = input("Do you go LEFT or RIGHT? ")

if choice == "left":
    print()
    print("You chose the left path!")
    print("You find a treasure chest full of gold!")
    print("YOU WIN!")
else:
    print()
    print("You chose the right path!")
    print("You meet a friendly dragon who gives you a ride home!")
    print("YOU WIN!")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
The story changes based on YOUR choice!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- `if choice == "left":` checks if they typed "left"
- `else:` handles everything that's NOT "left"
- The `==` (two equals) checks if things are the same
- Different choices lead to different stories!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Change the story! Make the left path scary and the right path funny!

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Both paths the same?** Make sure the `if` and `else` have different text
- **Error?** Check that you typed `"left"` exactly (lowercase)
- **Want more choices?** We'll learn that in the next lesson!

## 🌟 Show Your Parents!
"Look! I made an interactive story that changes based on my choices!"

You just unlocked the **Story Writer** superpower! ⭐
