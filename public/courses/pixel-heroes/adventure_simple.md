# Your First Adventure

Make a story where YOU choose what happens!

## What to Do
1. Press Run
2. Type "left" or "right" to choose!

```python
print("=== THE MYSTERIOUS FOREST ===")
print()
print("You are standing at the edge of a dark forest.")
print("There are two paths ahead of you.")
print()

choice = input("Do you go LEFT or RIGHT? ")

if choice == "left":
    print()
    print("You chose the left path!")
    print("You find a treasure chest full of gold!")
    print("YOU WIN!")
else:
    print()
    print("You chose the right path!")
    print("You meet a friendly dragon who gives you a ride home!")
    print("YOU WIN!")
```

## Remember
- `if choice == "left":` checks if they typed "left"
- `else:` handles everything else
- `==` checks if things are the same

## Try This
Change the story! Make different paths!

## If Stuck
- Make sure `if` and `else` have different text
- Type `"left"` exactly (lowercase)

You did it! ⭐
