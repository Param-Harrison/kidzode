# Your Name in Giant Letters

Want to see your name in HUGE letters? Let's do it!

Change `JACK` to YOUR name, then press Run. Watch your name appear big and bold!

```python
print("H E L L O   JACK")
print("YOU ARE AMAZING!")
```

**Tip:** Put text inside quotes `"like this"` and add spaces between letters to make them BIG!

Try changing what it says - make it your own!
