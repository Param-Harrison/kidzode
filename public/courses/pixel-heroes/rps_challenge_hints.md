# Hints

You need a loop that plays 5 rounds! Use `for round_num in range(1, 6):` to repeat 5 times.

---

Put ALL the game code inside the loop - asking for choice, checking winner, updating score. The score variables should be OUTSIDE the loop so they keep adding up!

---

After the loop ends, compare the final scores! Use `if player_score > computer_score:` to see who won, then print the champion.

---

Remember: score variables (`player_score`, `computer_score`, `ties`) must be created BEFORE the loop, not inside it!
