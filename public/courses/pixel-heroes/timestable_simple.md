# Times-Table Victory Fireworks

Welcome back, Character Creator! You've built amazing projects!
Now let's make learning math FUN with victory fireworks!
Can you make Python show a times table with celebrations?

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Print the 5 times table from 1 to 10!

## Let's Do It!
1. Read the code - see the loop doing multiplication!
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Watch the times table appear!

```python
# Print the 5 times table
print("=== 5 TIMES TABLE ===")
print()

for number in range(1, 11):
    answer = 5 * number
    print(f"5 x {number} = {answer}")
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
The entire 5 times table appears automatically!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- `range(1, 11)` counts from 1 to 10 (stops before 11)
- `5 * number` multiplies 5 by the current number
- The loop does all 10 calculations for you!
- Math becomes easy when Python does the work!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Change `5` to `7` to see the 7 times table instead!

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Wrong numbers?** Make sure you're multiplying `5 * number`
- **Not enough lines?** Check that you use `range(1, 11)` not `range(1, 10)`
- **Want a different table?** Change the `5` to any number!

## 🌟 Show Your Parents!
"Look! Python can do my times tables for me - all 10 at once!"

You just unlocked the **Math Wizard** superpower! ⭐
