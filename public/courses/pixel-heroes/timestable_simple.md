# Times Table

Print the 5 times table from 1 to 10!

## What to Do
1. Press Run
2. See the times table!

```python
# Print the 5 times table
print("=== 5 TIMES TABLE ===")
print()

for number in range(1, 11):
    answer = 5 * number
    print(f"5 x {number} = {answer}")
```

## Remember
- `range(1, 11)` counts from 1 to 10
- `5 * number` multiplies 5 by the number
- The loop does all 10 calculations!

## Try This
Change `5` to `7` to see the 7 times table!

## If Stuck
- Make sure you're multiplying `5 * number`
- Use `range(1, 11)` not `range(1, 10)`

You did it! ⭐
