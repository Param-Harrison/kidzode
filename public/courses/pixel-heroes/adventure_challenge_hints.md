# Hints

Start by describing where your character is! Use `print()` to set the scene, then ask for their first choice.

---

Use `if/else` to handle choices. After asking with `input()`, check what they typed: `if choice1 == "option1":` then do something, `else:` do something else.

---

To get 4 endings, you need nested `if/else`! Inside the first `if`, ask another question and use `if/else` again. This creates multiple paths!

---

Use f-strings to include the character's name: `print(f"{hero_name} finds a treasure!")`. Make each ending unique - happy, sad, funny, or scary!
