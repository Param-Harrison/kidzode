# Add More Fortunes to Your Magic 8-Ball

Awesome! Your Magic 8-Ball is getting better!
But only 3 fortunes? A real Magic 8-Ball has LOTS of answers!
Let's make your fortune list MUCH bigger!

## 🎯 Today's Mission
Add more fortunes to make your Magic 8-Ball more interesting!

## 📚 Before You Start
You know how to create lists and use `random.choice()` to pick from them.

## Let's Do It!
1. Look at the bigger list of fortunes below
2. Press the green **Run** button
3. Ask a question and see what you get!
4. Run it many times to see all the different answers!

```python
import random

# Ask the user for their question
question = input("Ask the Magic 8-Ball a yes/no question: ")

# Create a BIG list of possible fortunes
fortunes = [
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "No way!",
    "Maybe later!",
    "Ask again tomorrow!",
    "The stars say yes!",
    "Don't count on it!",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Not a chance!"
]

# Pick one fortune randomly
answer = random.choice(fortunes)

# Show the fortune
print("The Magic 8-Ball says...")
print(answer)
```

## ✨ Magic Moment
Now you have 8 different fortunes - just like a real Magic 8-Ball!

## 💡 Important Things to Remember
- Lists can have as many items as you want
- Put each item on its own line to make it easier to read
- Don't forget the comma after each item (except the last one!)
- The more fortunes you have, the more variety you get!

## 🎨 Try This Next!
Add your own custom fortunes! Make them funny or silly!

## 🤔 Stuck? Check This!
- **Error: invalid syntax?** Check that you have commas between all fortunes
- **Missing quotes?** Each fortune needs quotes around it
- **Bracket error?** Make sure you have `]` at the end of the list
- **Only seeing some fortunes?** That's normal - run it more times!

## 🌟 Show Your Parents!
"Look! My Magic 8-Ball has 8 different answers now - just like the real toy!"

You just unlocked the **Master Fortune Teller** superpower! ⭐
