# Hints

Think about what you need: two variables, one for your name and one for your friend's name.

---

Remember how you created variables before? Use `=` to save names, like `my_name = "YourName"`.

---

You need TWO variables. Create the first one: `my_name = "Rose"`. Then create a second one: `friend_name = "Jack"`.

---

Use both variables in your print statements! `print("Hello, " + my_name + "!")` and `print("Hello, " + friend_name + "!")`.
