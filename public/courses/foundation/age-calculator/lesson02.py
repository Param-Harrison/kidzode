# 🔢 LESSON 2: Text vs Numbers
# ========================================

# When you type a number, Python thinks it's text
age_text = input("How old are you? ")

# int() turns the text into a real number
age = int(age_text)

# Now we can do math!
next_year = age + 1

print("Next year you will be:")
print(next_year)

# ----------------------------------------
# 🎮 TRY THIS:
# Try adding 10 instead of 1!
# What age will you be in 10 years?
# ----------------------------------------
