# Challenge: Days Old 🏆

## Your Mission
How many days have you been alive? Let's find out!

## Your Task
1. Ask: "How old are you?"
2. Turn the answer into a number using `int()`
3. Multiply by 365 to get days
4. Print the result!

**Example output:**
```
How old are you? 10
You are this many days old:
3650
```

## Hint

days = age * 365
```

That's a lot of days! 🎉
