# Asking Questions ❓

## Your Mission
What if we want the computer to ask YOU something? Let's learn how to have a conversation with Python!

## The Magic Word: input()
When you use `input()`, Python shows a question and **waits** for you to type an answer.

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
```

This does two things:
1. Shows "What is your name?" on the screen
2. Waits for you to type, then saves your answer in the `name` box

## Try It!
1. Click **Run**
2. Look at the bottom of the screen — Python is asking a question!
3. Type your name and press **Enter**
4. Watch Python greet you! 👋

## What You Learned
✅ `input()` asks a question and waits for an answer
✅ The answer gets stored in a variable (a box)
✅ You can then use that variable later

## Coming Up Next
We'll use `input()` to build a birthday calculator! 🎂
