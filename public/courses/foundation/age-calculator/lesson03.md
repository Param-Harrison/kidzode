# Time Travel Math 🚀

## Quick Reminder
You learned that `int()` turns typed text into a real number for math. Now let's time travel!

## Your Mission
How old will you be in the year 2050? Let's find out!

## The Math
```
Your age in 2050 = Current age + Years until 2050
Years until 2050 = 2050 - 2025 = 25 years
```

So if you're 10 now: 10 + 25 = 35 years old in 2050!

## Try It!
1. Run the code
2. Type your current age
3. See your future age appear! 🔮

## What You Learned
✅ You can combine `input()`, `int()`, and math
✅ Variables can store calculations
✅ You just built a time machine! ⏰
