# Text vs Numbers 🔣

When you type with `input()`, Python thinks it's text (a "String"). If we want to do math, we have to tell Python it's a number (an "Integer").

### Instructions:
1. We use `int()` to turn text into a number.
2. Run the code and type your age.
3. Python will then add 1 to it!

### Achievement:
You've learned how to convert data types! 🧙‍♂️
