# Is it on the List?

Did we remember the milk?

Use the `in` keyword to check!

```python
cart = ["Apples", "Bread", "Candy"]

if "Milk" in cart:
    print("Got milk! 🥛")
else:
    print("Forgot milk! 😱")
```

You'll see:
```
Forgot milk! 😱
```

**How it works:** `"Milk" in cart` is a True/False question for the computer.

## Try This!
Add "Milk" to the list so you don't forget it!
