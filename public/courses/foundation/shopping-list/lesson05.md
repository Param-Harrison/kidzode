# Add Item

Oops! We forgot something!

We can add to a list with `.append()`.

```python
cart = ["Apples", "Milk"]
print(cart)

cart.append("Cookies")
print(cart)
```

You'll see:
```
['Apples', 'Milk']
['Apples', 'Milk', 'Cookies']
```

It adds it to the END of the list.

**How it works:** `cart.append("Cookies")` puts "Cookies" into the `cart`.

## Try This!
Start with an empty list `[]` and append 3 things!
