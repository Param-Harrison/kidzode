# Reading the List 📖

## Quick Reminder
You can add to lists and count them. Now let's print each item nicely!

## The Problem
When you print a list, it shows brackets:
```
['Pizza', 'Burgers', 'Tacos']
```

That's not very pretty! Let's print each item on its own line.

## Looping Through a List
Remember loops? We can use them with lists too!

```python
foods = ["Pizza", "Burgers", "Tacos"]

for food in foods:
    print(food)
```

This means: "For each food in the foods list, print it!"

Output:
```
Pizza
Burgers
Tacos
```

Much nicer! 🎉

## Try It!
1. Run the code
2. See each item printed nicely
3. Add more items and see them appear!

## What You Learned
✅ `for item in list:` goes through each item
✅ The loop runs once for each item
✅ Perfect for printing lists nicely!
