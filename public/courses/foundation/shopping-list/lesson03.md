# Check the List

Before we go to the store, let's check our list.

```python
cart = ["Apples", "Bread", "Milk"]

print("--- MY SHOPPING LIST ---")
print(cart)
print("------------------------")
```

Output:
```
--- MY SHOPPING LIST ---
['Apples', 'Bread', 'Milk']
------------------------
```

Looks official now!
