# The Empty List

Every shopping trip starts with an empty piece of paper!

In Python, an empty list looks like this: `[]`.

```python
cart = []
print(cart)
```

You'll see:
```
[]
```

It's waiting for you to add yummy food!

**How it works:** `[]` means "a list with nothing in it".

## Try This!
Create an empty list called `backpack`!
