# Adding to the List 🛒

## Your Mission
Let's build a shopping list! We'll learn how to add new items to a list while the program runs.

## Starting Empty
Sometimes you want to start with an empty list and add things as you go:
```python
my_list = []
```

This creates an empty list — like a blank piece of paper ready for a shopping list!

## Adding Items: .append()
To add something to a list, use `.append()`:
```python
my_list.append("Apples")
```

Now the list has one item: `["Apples"]`

Add more:
```python
my_list.append("Bananas")
my_list.append("Milk")
```

Now: `["Apples", "Bananas", "Milk"]`

## Try It!
1. Run the code
2. See the list grow as items are added!
3. Try adding your own items

## What You Learned
✅ `[]` creates an empty list
✅ `.append(item)` adds to the end of a list
✅ You can keep adding as many items as you want!
