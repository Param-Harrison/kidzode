# Add Multiple Items

You can call `.append()` as many times as you want!

```python
cart = []

cart.append("Bread")
cart.append("Eggs")
cart.append("Juice")

print(cart)
```

You'll see:
```
['Bread', 'Eggs', 'Juice']
```

This is how shopping apps work! You click "Add" and it appends!

## Try This!
Make a loop that appends "Candy" 5 times!
