# Hints for Item Search Challenge

## 🟢 Hint 1
Get the search term from the user:
```python
search = input("Search for: ")
```

## 🟡 Hint 2
The check should look like this:
```python
if search in items:
    # found
```

## 🟠 Hint 3
Try typing the word exactly as it is in the list (Python cares about capitals!).
