# Challenge 3: Packing List ✈️

## Your Mission
Going on a trip! Build a packing list step by step!

## Your Task
1. Create an empty list called `suitcase`
2. Ask the user for 3 items to pack (using `input()`)
3. Add each item to the suitcase using `.append()`
4. Print the final packing list using a loop

**Example:**
```
What do you want to pack? Shirt
What do you want to pack? Pants
What do you want to pack? Toothbrush

Your suitcase contains:
- Shirt

suitcase.append(item)
```

Bon voyage! ✈️
