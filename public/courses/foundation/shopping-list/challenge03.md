# CHALLENGE 3: Item Search 🔍

Can you engineer a system that checks if something special is already in your list?

### Your Task:
1. Create a list of 3 school supplies (like "Pen", "Eraser").
2. Ask the user: "What item are you looking for?".
3. Use an `if` statement to check if the item is `in` your list.
4. Print: "Found it!" if it's there, or "Not here!" if it's missing.
