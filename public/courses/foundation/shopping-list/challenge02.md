# CHALLENGE 2: Wish List 🌟

Instead of adding items one by one, let's use a loop to build a full wish list of 3 things!

### Your Task:
1. Create an empty list called `wish_list = []`.
2. Use a `for` loop that runs 3 times.
3. Inside the loop, ask the user: "What is your wish?".
4. Append the answer to your list.
5. Print the final list.

### Achievement:
You've engineered a batch input system for lists! 📋
