# Checking the Count 🔢

## Quick Reminder
You learned to add items to a list with `.append()`. But how many items are there?

## Your Mission
Let's learn to count items in a list!

## The len() Command
`len()` tells you how many items are in a list:
```python
my_list = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
count = len(my_list)
print(count)  # Shows: 3
```

`len` is short for "length" — the length of your list!

## Try It!
1. Run the code
2. See how many items are in the shopping list
3. Add more items and see the count change!

## What You Learned
✅ `len(list)` counts items in a list
✅ It works on any size list, even empty ones
✅ Useful for knowing "how many do I have?"
