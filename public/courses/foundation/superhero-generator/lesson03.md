# The Final Identity 💥

## Quick Reminder
You can pick random words from lists. Now let's combine them into a name!

## Your Mission
We have two words. Let's join them together!

## Ways to Join Text
You've seen these before:
1. Using `+`: `power + " " + hero`
2. Using commas in print: `print(power, hero)`

There's one more cool way: **f-strings**!

## What's an f-string?
An f-string lets you put variables INSIDE a piece of text:
```python
name = f"{power} {hero}"
```

The `f` before the quotes means "fill in the blanks"!
The `{power}` and `{hero}` are the blanks — Python fills them with the actual values.

## Try It!
1. Run the code
2. See your superhero name!
3. Run again for a different identity!

## What You Learned
✅ f-strings start with `f"..."`
✅ Use `{variable}` to insert variables
✅ It's often cleaner than using `+` signs!
