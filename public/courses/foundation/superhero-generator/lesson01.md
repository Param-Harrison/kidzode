# Super Parts 🦸‍♀️

## Your Mission
What's your secret identity? Today we'll build a generator that creates awesome superhero names!

## The Plan
A superhero name has two parts:
1. A **power word** (like "Mega", "Shadow", "Electric")
2. A **hero word** (like "Falcon", "Storm", "Knight")

Put them together: **Mega Falcon**, **Shadow Storm**, **Electric Knight**!

## Two Lists
We need two lists — one for each part:

```python
powers = ["Mega", "Shadow", "Electric"]
heroes = ["Falcon", "Storm", "Knight"]
```

## Try It!
1. Run the code to see both lists
2. Think about what combinations are possible
3. Add your own words!

## What You Learned
✅ We can have multiple lists in one program
✅ Each list holds one "category" of words
✅ Soon we'll mix them randomly! 🎲
