# CHALLENGE 3: Hero Team 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️🦸

One hero is cool, but a TEAM is better! Let's generate a full squad.

### Your Task:
1. Create a loop that runs 3 times (using `range(3)`).
2. Inside the loop, pick a random adjective (like "Super") and a random noun (like "Lion").
3. Print the team member's name.
4. Watch as Python creates a whole team for you!

### Achievement:
You've engineered a team generator using loops and random logic! 🛡️
