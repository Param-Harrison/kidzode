# Mixing the Superpowers 🌪️

## Quick Reminder
You have two lists: power words and hero words. Now let's pick randomly from each!

## Your Mission
We'll use `random.choice()` twice — once for each list!

## The Code
```python
import random

powers = ["Mega", "Shadow"]
heroes = ["Falcon", "Storm"]

power = random.choice(powers)  # Pick from powers
hero = random.choice(heroes)   # Pick from heroes
```

Now we have two random words!

## Try It!
1. Run the code multiple times
2. See how you get different combinations each time!
3. Try adding more words to the lists

## What You Learned
✅ You can use `random.choice()` on ANY list
✅ Each time gives a different result
✅ Two random picks = one unique name every time! 🎰
