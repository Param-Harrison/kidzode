# Variable for Table

Instead of typing `5` everywhere, let's use a variable!

```python
number = 5

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{number} x {i} = {number * i}")
```

You'll see:
```
5 x 1 = 5
...
```

It looks the same, BUT now it's super easy to change!

**Why this is better:** Change `number = 5` to `number = 8` and the WHOLE code updates!

## Try This!
Change `number` to `12` and run it!
