# Your Answers

Now YOU take the quiz!

We'll make a list for YOUR answers.
Change the zeros `0` to the real answers!

```python
questions = ["2 x 2", "3 x 3", "4 x 4"]
# CHANGE THESE ZEROS!
my_answers = [0, 0, 0] 

print(f"Your answers: {my_answers}")
```

You'll see `[0, 0, 0]` until you fix them!

**How it works:** You are the player! You edit the code to play!

## Try This!
Change `my_answers` to `[4, 9, 16]` and run it!
