# ========================================
# 📝 LESSON 2: List of Answers
# ========================================

# A list holds many things inside square brackets
# Each item is separated by a comma
answers = [
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "Ask again later",
    "No way!",
    "Maybe..."
]

# Show all the answers
print("My 8-Ball can say:")
print(answers)

# ----------------------------------------
# 🎮 TRY THIS:
# Add a new answer to the list!
# Don't forget the comma after the one before it.
# Example: "Try asking tomorrow"
# ----------------------------------------
