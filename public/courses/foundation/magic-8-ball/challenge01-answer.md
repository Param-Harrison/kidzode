### One way to solve it:

```python
import random

fortunes = [
    "You will become a coding master!",
    "A cat will follow you home.",
    "You will find money on the ground.",
    "Tomorrow will be sunny.",
    "You will eat something delicious!"
]

print("Your fortune is:")
print(random.choice(fortunes))
```
