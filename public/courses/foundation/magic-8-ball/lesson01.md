# The Secret Toolbox 🧰

## Your Mission
Today you're building a Magic 8-Ball that answers questions! But first, you need a special power: **randomness**.

## What's a Toolbox?
Python has extra powers stored in "toolboxes" (called **modules**). To use a power, you first open the toolbox with `import`.

```python
import random
```

This opens the `random` toolbox. Now you can pick random numbers!

## Random Numbers
Once you have the toolbox open, you can use `random.randint()`:
```python
number = random.randint(1, 10)
```

This picks a random number between 1 and 10. Every time you run it, you might get a different number!

## Try It!
1. Click **Run**
2. See your lucky number!
3. Run it again — did it change?

## What You Learned
✅ `import random` opens the randomness toolbox
✅ `random.randint(1, 10)` picks a number from 1 to 10
✅ Random means different every time! 🎲
