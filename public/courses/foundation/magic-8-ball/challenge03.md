# Challenge 3: Snack Decider 🍿

## Your Mission
What snack should you have? Let Python decide!

## Your Task
1. Create a list called `snacks` with your favorite snacks
2. Ask "What snack are you craving?" (just for fun!)
3. Pick a random snack
4. Print "You should have:" and the snack!

**Example output:**
```
What snack are you craving? chips
You should have:
Popcorn
```

## Hint
The input is just for fun — you still pick randomly!

Snack time! 🍿
