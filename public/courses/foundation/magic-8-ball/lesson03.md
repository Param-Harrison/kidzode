# Picking Randomly 🎱

Now we can tell Python to pick one random item from our list using `random.choice()`.

### Instructions:
1. We use a variable to ask a question (just for fun).
2. Then we use `random.choice(answers)` to pick the result.
3. Run the code and ask it a question!

### Achievement:
You've built your first interactive game! 🔮
