# Picking Randomly 🎱

## Quick Reminder
You have a list of answers. Now let's pick one at random!

## Your Mission

## The Magic Power: random.choice()
Remember our random toolbox? It has another power:
```python
random.choice(answers)
```

This looks at your list and picks ONE random item from it!

## The Complete Magic 8-Ball
```python
import random
answers = ["Yes", "No", "Maybe"]
result = random.choice(answers)
print(result)
```

## Try It!
1. Run the code
2. Ask a yes/no question
3. See your answer! 🔮
4. Run again for a different answer!
