# List of Answers 📝

## Quick Reminder
You opened the `random` toolbox! Now let's give your Magic 8-Ball some answers.

## Your Mission
A real Magic 8-Ball has many possible answers. We need to store all of them somewhere!

## What's a List?
A **list** holds multiple things in order. Use square brackets `[ ]`:

```python
answers = ["Yes", "No", "Maybe"]
```

Think of it like a list on a piece of paper:
```
1. Yes
2. No
3. Maybe
```

## Try It!
1. Look at the list of answers
2. Run the code to see all the answers
3. Try adding your own answer!

## What You Learned
✅ Lists use square brackets `[ ]`
✅ Items are separated by commas
✅ Lists can hold as many things as you want

## Coming Up Next
We'll pick a RANDOM answer from this list! 🎱
