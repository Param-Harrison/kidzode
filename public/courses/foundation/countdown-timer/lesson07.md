# Your First For Loop

Get ready for MAGIC! Count to 5 with just 2 lines!

A **for loop** repeats code. Like telling a robot: "Do this 5 times!"

```python
for number in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    print(number)
```

**Important:** The second line is indented (has spaces)!

You'll see:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

WHOA! 2 lines did what used to take 5! This is the power of loops!

**How it works:**
- `for number in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:` - For each number...
- `    print(number)` - ...print it

The indent tells Python "this is inside the loop."

## Try This!
Change to `[10, 20, 30]` - what prints?
