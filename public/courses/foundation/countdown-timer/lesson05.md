# Change the Variable

Variables can change! That's why they're called "vari-ABLE"!

```python
countdown = 10
print(countdown)
countdown = 5
print(countdown)
```

You'll see:
```
10
5
```

Same box, different number! Variables can change anytime!

**How it works:** Line 3 replaces the old value (10) with the new value (5).
