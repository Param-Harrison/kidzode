# Count Backwards

Now for the REAL countdown! Let's count backwards!

`range()` can take THREE numbers: `range(start, stop, step)`

Use `-1` for the step to count backwards!

```python
for number in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(number)
```

You'll see:
```
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

Real countdown! 🚀

**How it works:**
- Start at 10
- Stop before 0 (so stop at 1)
- Count by -1 (backwards!)

## Try This!
`range(20, 0, -1)` - countdown from 20!
