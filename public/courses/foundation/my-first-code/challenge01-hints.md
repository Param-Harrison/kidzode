# Hints for Challenge 1: Your Message 💡

## Stuck? Here are some hints!

### Hint 1: Creating the variable
Remember, a variable is like a box. Put your food inside quotes:
```python
food = "Pizza"
```

### Hint 2: Printing
Use `print()` twice — once for "I love" and once for your variable:
```python
print("I love")
print(food)
```

You've got this! 💪
