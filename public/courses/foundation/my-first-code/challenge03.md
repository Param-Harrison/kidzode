# Challenge 3: Weather Report 🌤️

## Your Mission
Can you make Python show a weather report? Let's use multiple variables!

## Your Task
1. Create a variable called `city` with your city name
2. Create a variable called `weather` (like "Sunny" or "Rainy")
3. Create a variable called `temperature` with a number (like `25`)
4. Print each one with a label!

**Example output:**
```
City:
Paris
Weather:
Sunny
Temperature:
25
```

## Hint
Remember:
- Text goes in quotes: `city = "Paris"`
- Numbers don't need quotes: `temperature = 25`
