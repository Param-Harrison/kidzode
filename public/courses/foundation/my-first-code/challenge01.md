# Challenge: Your Message 🏆

## Your Mission
Time to use what you learned! Can you make your own message appear?

## Your Task
1. Create a variable called `food` and put your favorite food inside
2. Print the message "I love"
3. Print your `food` variable

**Example output:**
```
I love
Pizza
```

## Hint
Remember:
- Variables are like boxes: `food = "Pizza"`
- Use `print()` to show things

You've got this! 💪
