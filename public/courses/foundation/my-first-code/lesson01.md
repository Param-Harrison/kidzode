# Hello World! 🚀

## Your Mission
You're about to become a real coder! Today, you'll make the computer **talk** to you. Ready?

## What's Happening?
Look at the code on the right. See the word `print`? That's your magic spell!

When you write `print("Hello, World!")`, you're telling the computer:
> "Hey computer, show these words on the screen!"

The computer reads your message and displays it. Simple!

## Try It!
1. Click the **Run** button
2. Watch the words appear below
3. You did it! 🎉

## What You Learned
✅ `print()` shows text on the screen
✅ Text goes inside quotes `"like this"`

## Fun Fact
Every programmer in the world starts with "Hello, World!" — now you're one of us! 🌍
