# Hello World! 🌍

Welcome to your first coding lesson! Today, you're going to make the computer speak.

In Python, we use the `print()` command to show text on the screen.

### Instructions:
1. Look at the code on the right.
2. It says `print("Hello, World!")`.
3. The quotes `" "` tell Python that this is text, not code instructions.
4. Press the **Run** button to see what happens!

### Achievement:
You've just written your first line of code! You're officially a programmer now. 🚀
