# Challenge 2: Math Whiz 🧮

## Your Mission
Can you use Python to solve a sharing problem?

## Your Task
You have 24 cookies and 6 friends. How many cookies does each friend get?

1. Create a variable called `cookies` and set it to `24`
2. Create a variable called `friends` and set it to `6`
3. Create a variable called `each` that divides cookies by friends
4. Print "Each friend gets:"
5. Print the answer!

**Example output:**
```
Each friend gets:
4.0
```

## Hint
Remember:
- Division uses the `/` symbol
- `each = cookies / friends`

Fair sharing! 🍪
