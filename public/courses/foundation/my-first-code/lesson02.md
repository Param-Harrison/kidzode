# Talking to the Computer 🗣️

Computers can store information using **Variables**. Think of a variable like a box with a label.

### Instructions:
1. We created a "box" named `name`.
2. Inside the box, we put the text `"Python Pirate"`.
3. When we `print(name)`, the computer looks inside the box and shows us what's there!

### Achievement:
You've learned how to store information in a computer's memory! 📦
