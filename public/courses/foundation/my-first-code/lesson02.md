# Talking to the Computer 🗣️

## Quick Reminder
Last time, you used `print()` to show words on the screen. Nice work!

## Your Mission
Now let's teach the computer to **remember** things. We'll use something called a **variable**.

## What's a Variable?
Imagine a box with a label on it. You can put something inside the box, and later, you can ask the computer: "What's in this box?"

```
📦 The box is called: name
📝 Inside the box: "Python Pirate"
```

In code, we write it like this:
```python
name = "Python Pirate"
```

The `=` sign means "put this inside the box."

## Try It!
1. Look at the code — we made a box called `name`
2. Click **Run**
3. The computer opens the box and shows what's inside!

## What You Learned
✅ A **variable** is like a labeled box that holds information
✅ Use `=` to put something in the box
✅ Use `print(variable_name)` to see what's inside
