# The Computer Calculator 🔢

## Quick Reminder
You learned that variables are like labeled boxes. We can store words (text) inside them!

## Your Mission
Did you know your computer is the fastest calculator in the world? Let's make it do some math!

## Math Symbols in Code
Python uses these symbols:
| You Want | You Type |
|----------|----------|
| Plus | `+` |
| Minus | `-` |
| Times | `*` (the star key) |
| Divide | `/` (the slash key) |

## How It Works
You can do math directly:
```python
print(10 + 5)   # Shows: 15
```

Or use variables:
```python
cookies = 10
eaten = 3
left = cookies - eaten
print(left)     # Shows: 7
```

## Try It!
1. Run the code to see Python solve math problems
2. Notice: numbers don't need quotes!
3. Text needs quotes: `"hello"`, numbers don't: `10`

## What You Learned
✅ Python can do math super fast
✅ Use `+` `-` `*` `/` for math
✅ Numbers don't need quotes around them
