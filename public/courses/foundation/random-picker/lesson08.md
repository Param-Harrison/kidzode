# Multiple Lists

You can have as many lists as you want!

```python
import random

colors = ["Red", "Blue", "Green"]
shapes = ["Circle", "Square", "Triangle"]

color = random.choice(colors)
shape = random.choice(shapes)

print(f"Draw a {color} {shape}")
```

You'll see:
```
Draw a Blue Circle
```

Mix and match! Infinite possibilities!

## Try This!
Add a `sizes` list (Big, Small) and add it to the sentence!
