# Create a List

Let's make a list of friends!

Lists can hold text (strings) or numbers.

```python
friends = ["Jack", "Sarah", "Mike"]
ages = [10, 11, 9]

print(friends)
print(ages)
```

You'll see:
```
['Jack', 'Sarah', 'Mike']
[10, 11, 9]
```

You stored 3 names and 3 ages in just 2 variables!

**Remember:** Text needs quotes `"Jack"`, numbers don't `10`.
