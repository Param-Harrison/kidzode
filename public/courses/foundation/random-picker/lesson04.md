# Print All Items

Let's print every item in the list, one by one.

We can use a **for loop** with a list!

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

You'll see:
```
apple
banana
orange
```

Much cleaner than printing the whole list with brackets `[]`!

**How it works:**
- `for fruit in fruits:` means "take one item, call it 'fruit', and do this..."
- It repeats for every item in the list!

## Try This!
Add "grape" to the list and run it again!
