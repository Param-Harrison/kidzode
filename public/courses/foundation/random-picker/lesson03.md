# Access List Items

What if you only want the *first* item?

Computers count starting from 0!
- 1st item = index 0
- 2nd item = index 1
- 3rd item = index 2

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print(fruits[0])
```

You'll see:
```
apple
```

**How it works:** `fruits[0]` gets the item at position 0 (the first one).

## Try This!
Try `print(fruits[1])` and `print(fruits[2])`. What happens if you try `fruits[3]`?
