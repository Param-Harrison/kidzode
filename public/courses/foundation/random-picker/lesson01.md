# What is a List?

Imagine a shopping list. It has many items, but it's just one piece of paper.

In Python, a **list** is a variable that can hold MANY things at once!

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print(fruits)
```

You'll see:
```
['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
```

Instead of 3 variables (`fruit1`, `fruit2`, `fruit3`), you just need one list!

**How it works:**
- `[` starts the list
- `]` ends the list
- `,` separates items

## Try This!
Make a list of your favorite colors!
