# Decimals (Floats)

Numbers with decimal points are called **floats**!

```python
price = 9.99
tax = 1.50
total = price + tax
print(total)
```

You'll see:
```
11.49
```

Floats work just like regular numbers! Perfect for money!

## Try This!
```python
pizza_cost = 12.50
drink_cost = 2.99
total = pizza_cost + drink_cost
print(total)
```
