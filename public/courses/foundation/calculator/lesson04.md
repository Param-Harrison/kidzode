# Add Variables

Now let's add the variables together!

```python
first_number = 10
second_number = 5
result = first_number + second_number
print(result)
```

You'll see:
```
15
```

You added variables! The computer looked inside both boxes and added them!

**How it works:**
- `first_number + second_number` = `10 + 5` = `15`
- Store the answer in `result`
- Print it!

## Try This!
Try different numbers and see what you get!
