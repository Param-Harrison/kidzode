# Division

Let's divide numbers! Use the `/` symbol:

```python
print(20 / 4)
```

You'll see:
```
5.0
```

Notice the `.0`? Division always gives you a decimal number!

**How it works:** `20 / 4` means "split 20 into 4 equal parts"

## Try This!
```python
pizza_slices = 12
people = 3
slices_per_person = pizza_slices / people
print(slices_per_person)
```
