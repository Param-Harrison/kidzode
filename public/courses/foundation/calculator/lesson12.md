# Multiple Calculations

Let's do several calculations and print them nicely!

```python
price = 25.00
discount = 5.00
tax = 2.50

after_discount = price - discount
final_price = after_discount + tax

print(f"Original price: ${price}")
print(f"After discount: ${after_discount}")
print(f"Final price: ${final_price}")
```

You'll see:
```
Original price: $25.0
After discount: $20.0
Final price: $22.5
```
