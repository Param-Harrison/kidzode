# Wait for It... ⏳

The computer counts too fast! To make a real timer, we need Python to wait for 1 second between numbers. We use another module called `time`.

### Instructions:
1. `import time` at the top.
2. Inside the loop, use `time.sleep(1)` to wait for 1 second.
3. Run the code and watch it count slowly... like a real clock!

### Achievement:
You've learned how to control the speed of your code! ⏱️
