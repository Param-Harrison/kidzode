# Challenge 2: Slow Motion Timer ⏱️

## Your Mission
Create a countdown that waits between numbers!

## Your Task
1. Count down from 5 to 1
2. Use `time.sleep()` to wait 1 second between each
3. Print "Time's up!" at the end

**What happens:**
```
5 (waits 1 second)
4 (waits 1 second)
3 (waits 1 second)
2 (waits 1 second)
1 (waits 1 second)
Time's up!
```

## Hint
Don't forget `import time` at the top!

Slow and steady! ⏱️
