# CHALLENGE: Custom Countdown 🏆

Can you create a countdown where the user chooses the starting number?

### Your Task:
1. Ask the user: "How many seconds until launch?"
2. Turn that input into a number.
3. Use that number as the start for your `range()`.
4. Add a `time.sleep(1)` inside the loop.

Good luck, Flight Commander!
