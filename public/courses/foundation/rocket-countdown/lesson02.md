# Counting Backwards 逆

For a real rocket launch, we need to count down from 10 to 1. We can do this by telling `range()` where to start, where to stop, and how to "step" (count).

### Instructions:
1. `range(10, 0, -1)` means:
   - Start at 10
   - Stop before 0
   - Subtract 1 each time
2. Run the code to see the countdown!

### Achievement:
You've mastered the advanced use of ranges! 📉
