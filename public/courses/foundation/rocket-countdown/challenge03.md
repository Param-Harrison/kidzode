# Challenge 3: Count Up Launch 🏎️

## Your Mission
Instead of counting DOWN, count UP!

## Your Task
1. Count UP from 1 to 5
2. Wait 1 second between each number
3. Print "GO!" at the end

**What happens:**
```
1 (waits)
2 (waits)
3 (waits)
4 (waits)
5 (waits)
GO! 🏁
```

## Hint
For counting UP: `range(1, 6)` gives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Ready, set, GO! 🏎️
