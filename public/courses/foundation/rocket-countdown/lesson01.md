# Counting with Range 🔢

## Your Mission
3... 2... 1... BLAST OFF! 🚀 We're going to build a rocket countdown timer!

## Quick Reminder: Loops
You learned that `for count in range(5)` runs 5 times. Now let's see exactly what numbers we get!

## What range() Gives You
```python
for number in range(5):
    print(number)
```

This prints: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

See that? It starts at **0** and goes up to (but not including) **5**!

## Want to Start at 1?
You can tell `range()` where to start:
```python
for number in range(1, 6):
    print(number)
```

This prints: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

The format is: `range(start, stop)`
- Start at 1
- Stop before 6

## Try It!
1. Run the code
2. See Python count from 0 to 4
3. Try changing the numbers!

## What You Learned
✅ `range(5)` gives 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
✅ `range(1, 6)` gives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
✅ It always stops BEFORE the second number
