# Welcome to Rocket Countdown! 🚀
3... 2... 1... BLAST OFF! We're going to build a countdown timer for a space mission.

## Counting with Range 🔢

The `range()` function is very powerful. It can generate a sequence of numbers for our loops.

### Instructions:
1. `range(5)` gives us numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
2. Run the code to see Python count!

### Achievement:
You've learned the engine behind most loops! 🚂
