# Growing Pattern (Triangle)

Let's make a shape that changes! A triangle!

We need the loop variable `i`. It counts for us!

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

It counts up! We can use this to make growing stars!

## Try This!
Run the code to see the numbers count up!
