# Final Challenge: Pyramid Pattern

Build a majestic pyramid! 🏜️

You need to combine **spaces** and **stars**!

1. As you go down, spaces get fewer
2. As you go down, stars get more

Example output for height 5:
```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

**Hint:**
- Row 0: 4 spaces, 1 star
- Row 1: 3 spaces, 3 stars
- Row 2: 2 spaces, 5 stars...

Can you find the math pattern?

```python
# Write your code here!

```
