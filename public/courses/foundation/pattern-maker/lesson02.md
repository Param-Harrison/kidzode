# Repeat Symbols

Typing `******` is boring. Let Python do the work!

Remember the `*` math tool? It multiplies numbers, but it REPEATS strings!

```python
print("*" * 10)
```

You'll see:
```
**********
```

Ten stars instantly!

**How it works:** `"*" * 10` means "write * ten times".

## Try This!
Print 50 smiley faces `:)`!
