# Variables for Patterns

Let's save our pattern in a variable so we can change it easily.

```python
symbol = "#"
width = 5

print(symbol * width)
```

You'll see:
```
#####
```

Change `width` to 20 and run it again. The line grows!

**Why this is cool:** You change one number, and the whole pattern updates!

## Try This!
Make a variable `pattern = "<>"` and print it 10 times!
