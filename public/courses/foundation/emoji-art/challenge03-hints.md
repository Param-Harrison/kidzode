# Hints for Multi-Shape Art Challenge

## 🟢 Hint 1
Create your two emojis:
```python
e1 = "🍕"
e2 = "🍔"
```

## 🟡 Hint 2
Each loop should have its own range number:
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(e1, end="")
print() # Add this to start a new line for the next set!
```

## 🟠 Hint 3
Try changing the `range()` numbers to see what happens to the art!
