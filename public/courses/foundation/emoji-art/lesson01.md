# Emoji Power ⚡

## Your Mission
Let's draw with code! We're going to make cool patterns using emojis.

## The Magic Trick: Multiplying Text
In Python, you can repeat text by multiplying it with a number!

```python
print("⭐" * 5)
```

This prints: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

It's like saying "star times 5" = 5 stars in a row!

## Try It!
1. Run the code to see the stars
2. Try changing the number
3. Try a different emoji!

## What You Learned
✅ `"text" * number` repeats the text
✅ Works with emojis, letters, words — any text!
✅ This is a shortcut for typing the same thing many times
