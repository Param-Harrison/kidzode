# The Name Variable 🏷️

## Quick Reminder
You just made a cool border with `print()`. Now let's add YOUR name!

## Your Mission
We'll use a **variable** (remember — it's like a labeled box!) to store your name.

## How It Works
```python
my_name = "Alex"
```

Now `my_name` is a box with "Alex" inside. We can use this box anywhere in our code!

## Printing Variables
We can print text and variables together:
```python
print("*", my_name, "*")
```

The commas separate different things to print. Python automatically adds spaces between them.

## Try It!
1. Find the line `my_name = "Alex"`
2. Change "Alex" to YOUR name
3. Click **Run** and see your name in the tag!

## What You Learned
✅ Variables let us store and reuse information
✅ Commas in `print()` let us combine text and variables
✅ Your name is now part of the code!
