# Quotes and Strings

You can use single quotes `'` or double quotes `"` for strings!

Both work the same:
- `"Hello"` - double quotes
- `'Hello'` - single quotes

```python
print("Hello")
print('World')
```

You'll see:
```
Hello
World
```

Both work! Use whichever you like!

**When to use each:** Use single quotes when your text has double quotes inside:
`print('She said "Hi!"')`
