# Store Text in a Variable

Just like numbers, you can store text in variables!

```python
name = "Jack"
```

Nothing prints yet - the computer just remembers it!

You stored text! The computer remembers your name!

**How it works:**
- `name` = variable name
- `=` = store
- `"Jack"` = the text to store

## Try This!
Change "Jack" to YOUR name!
