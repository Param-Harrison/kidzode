# Adding Symbols ✨

## Quick Reminder
You can print variables with text using commas. Now let's learn another way!

## Your Mission
What if you want to join words together without extra spaces? We use the `+` sign!

## Joining Text Together
The `+` sign glues pieces of text together:
```python
"Hello" + "World"   # Makes: "HelloWorld"
"Hello " + "World"  # Makes: "Hello World"
```

See the difference? If you want a space, you need to add it inside the quotes!

## Try It!
1. Look at how we join the title and name
2. Click **Run** to see the result
3. Try changing the title or name!

## What You Learned
✅ The `+` sign joins text together (called "concatenation")
✅ You control the spaces yourself
✅ You can build longer messages from smaller parts
