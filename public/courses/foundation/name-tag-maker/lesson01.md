# Print Text

Let's print words instead of numbers!

Text in programming is called a **string**. Put text in quotes: `"like this"`

```python
print("Hello")
```

You'll see:
```
Hello
```

You printed text! This is how you make computers talk!

**How it works:** Quotes `"` tell Python "this is text, not code"

## Try This!
Print your name: `print("Your Name")`
