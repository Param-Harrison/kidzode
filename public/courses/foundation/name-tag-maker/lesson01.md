# Design Your Tag 🎨

## Your Mission
Every coder needs a cool name tag! Let's build one together using code.

## What's Happening?
We're going to print a design made of stars. Each `print()` shows one line.

When you have multiple `print()` commands, they run one after another — like reading a book line by line!

## Try It!
1. Look at the code — it has 5 `print()` commands
2. Click **Run**
3. Watch your tag appear! ⭐

## What You Learned
✅ Multiple `print()` lines run top to bottom
✅ You can make shapes and designs with text
✅ Stars, dashes, and symbols can be art!

## Coming Up Next
We'll put YOUR name inside this tag!
