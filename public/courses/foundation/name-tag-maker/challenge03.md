# Challenge 3: Greeting Card 💌

## Your Mission
Create a digital greeting card for someone special!

## Your Task
1. Create a variable `to_name` (who is this for?)
2. Create a variable `from_name` (that's you!)
3. Create a variable `message` (like "Happy Birthday!")
4. Print a greeting card!

**Example output:**
```
***********************
  To: Grandma
  Happy Birthday!
  From: Maya
***********************
```

## Hint
Use print() with commas:
```python
print("  To:", to_name)
```

Spread the joy! 💖
