# CHALLENGE 3: Digital Greeting 💌

Can you use your name tag skills to build a digital greeting card?

### Your Task:
1. Create a variable for a `friend_name`.
2. Create a variable for a `gift` (like "Lego" or "Cake").
3. Print a greeting card that uses both variables and has a nice border.
   Example:
   ```
   *********************
   * To: Sam           *
   * Enjoy your Lego!  *
   *********************
   ```

### Achievement:
You've engineered a digital gift that you can send to anyone! 🎁
