# Split into Words

How do we count WORDS, not letters?

We use `.split()`. It chops a sentence into a list!

```python
sentence = "I love coding"
words = sentence.split()

print(words)
```

You'll see:
```
['I', 'love', 'coding']
```

It split the sentence at every space!

**How it works:** Now you have a list of 3 items!

## Try This!
Split "Cats are the best" into words!
