# String Methods

Strings have special superpowers called **methods**.

They attach to the variable with a dot `.`

```python
name = "param"
print(name.upper())
```

You'll see:
```
PARAM
```

It shouts your name!

**How it works:** `.upper()` converts everything to UPPERCASE.

## Try This!
Try `.lower()` on "LOUD NOISES"!
