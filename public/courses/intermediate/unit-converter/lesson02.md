# Length & Weight 📏

## Quick Reminder
You learned to create conversion functions with `return`. Now let's add more conversions!

## Your Mission
Build a collection of useful converters for length and weight.

## Length Converters
```python
def cm_to_inches(cm):
    return cm / 2.54

def meters_to_feet(m):
    return m * 3.281
```

## Weight Converters
```python
def kg_to_pounds(kg):
    return kg * 2.205

def pounds_to_kg(lb):
    return lb / 2.205
```

## Try It!
1. Run the code
2. Try converting your height!
3. Try converting your weight!

## What You Learned
✅ Each conversion gets its own function
✅ Some use multiply, some use divide
✅ Build a library of converters!
