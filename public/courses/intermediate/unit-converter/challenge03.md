# CHALLENGE 3: Universal Loader 🚛

Let's make a function that can run ANY conversion function you give it!

### Your Task:
1. Write a function `convert_and_print(value, function_name)`.
2. Inside, call the function like this: `result = function_name(value)`.
3. Print the result nicely.
4. Pass your `km_to_miles` or `kg_to_lbs` functions into it!

### Achievement:
You've engineered a higher-order function that takes other functions as inputs! 🧠
