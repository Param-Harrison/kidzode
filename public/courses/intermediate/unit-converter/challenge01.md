# CHALLENGE: Custom Converter 🏆

Can you build a tool that lets the user pick which unit they want to convert?

### Your Task:
1. Ask the user: "1. Km to Miles, 2. Celsius to Fahrenheit".
2. Use an `if` statement to check their choice.
3. Ask for the value they want to convert.
4. Call the correct function and print the result.

### Engineering Challenge:
Can you add a 3rd option of your own (like Grams to Ounces)?

Good luck, Engineer!
