# Cleaning the Console 🧹

Right now, our clock prints a new line every second. A real digital clock stays in one place. We can fix this using a special "carriage return" character: `\r`.

### Instructions:
1. Use `print(time_string, end="\r")`.
2. The `end="\r"` tells Python to go back to the start of the *same line* instead of starting a new one.
3. Run the code to see a smooth, single-line digital clock!

### Achievement:
You've learned how to manipulate the console for a better User Experience (UX)! 🎨
