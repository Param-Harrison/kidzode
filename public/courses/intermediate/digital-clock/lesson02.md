# Live Time 🔄

A clock isn't very useful if it only shows the time once! We need to use a loop to update the time every second.

### Instructions:
1. Put the time-getting code inside a `while True:` loop.
2. Use `time.sleep(1)` to wait for one second before the next update.
3. Run the code and watch your clock tick!

### Achievement:
You've built a program that runs continuously and responds to real-time events! ⏳
