# Welcome to Digital Clock! ⏰
Time is precious. Let's build a sleek, real-time clock that shows the exact hour, minute, and second on your screen!

## Time Management 🕰️

To make a clock, we need to get the current time from your computer. Python has a secret module called `datetime` that handles everything about dates and times.

### Instructions:
1. We use `datetime.datetime.now()` to get the current moment.
2. We use `.strftime()` (short for **string format time**) to make it look nice.
3. Run the code to see the current time in a professional format!

### Achievement:
You've learned how to extract and format real-world data from the system! 🛰️
