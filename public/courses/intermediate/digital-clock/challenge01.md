# CHALLENGE: Multi-City Clock 🌍

Can you build a clock that shows the time for different cities?

### Your Task:
1. Use your `datetime` knowledge to get the current time.
2. Add or subtract hours to "mock" a different timezone (e.g., if it's 2 PM here, it might be 7 PM in London).
3. Use a loop to show multiple city times at once.

### Engineering Challenge:
Can you use a **Dictionary** to store the city names and their hour offsets?
e.g. `offsets = {"New York": -5, "London": 0, "Tokyo": 9}`

Good luck, Global Engineer!
