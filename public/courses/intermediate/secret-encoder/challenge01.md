# CHALLENGE: Full Secret Agent 🏆

Can you build a tool that lets you choose to **ENCODE** or **DECODE**?

### Your Task:
1. Ask the user for a message.
2. Ask for a secret shift number.
3. Encode the message.
4. **Extra:** How would you *decode*? (Hint: Subtract the shift!)

### Engineering Goal:
Try to use an `if` statement to let the user pick "E" for Encode and "D" for Decode.

Good luck, Agent!
