# The Simple Shift ⚙️

To hide a message, we can shift each letter by a certain number. This is called a **Caesar Cipher**.

### Instructions:
1. We take the code for 'A' (which is 65).
2. We add 1 to it (making it 66).
3. We turn 66 back into a letter ('B').
4. Run the code to see 'A' become 'B'!

### Achievement:
You've just performed your first "encryption"! 🕵️‍♂️
