Want to send hidden messages to your friends? We're going to build a spy tool that turns normal text into secret codes!

# Character Secrets 🤫

Every letter on your keyboard has a secret number! In Python, we can find it using `ord()` and turn it back into a letter using `chr()`.

### Instructions:
1. `ord('a')` gives you the number for 'a'.
2. `chr(97)` gives you the letter 'a' back.
3. Run the code to see how Python "sees" letters.

### Achievement:
You've unlocked the secret numeric code of the alphabet! 🔢
