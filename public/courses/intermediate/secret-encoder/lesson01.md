# Character Secrets 🤫

## Your Mission
Want to send hidden messages that only your friends can read? Today we're building a secret code encoder!

## The Secret: Every Letter Has a Number
Computers store letters as numbers! The letter "A" is actually stored as the number 65.

## Two Magic Commands
Python has two commands that reveal this secret:

| Command | What It Does | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `ord("A")` | Letter → Number | Returns 65 |
| `chr(65)` | Number → Letter | Returns "A" |

Think of it like a secret decoder ring:
- `ord` = "original number" (letter to number)
- `chr` = "character" (number to letter)

## Try It!
1. Run the code to see the secret numbers
2. Try finding the number for your first initial!
3. What number is "B"? What about "Z"?

## What You Learned
✅ Every letter has a secret number code
✅ `ord()` turns a letter into its number
✅ `chr()` turns a number back into a letter

## Coming Up Next
We'll use these numbers to hide messages! 🕵️
