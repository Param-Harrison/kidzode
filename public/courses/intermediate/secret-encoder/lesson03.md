# Encoding a Word 📝

Now let's use a loop to encode a whole word! We'll go through each letter one by one.

### Instructions:
1. We use `for char in word:`.
2. For each character, we shift it and add it to our `secret` string.
3. Run the code to see "Python" become something else!

### Achievement:
You've built a system that handles multiple pieces of data at once! ⚙️
