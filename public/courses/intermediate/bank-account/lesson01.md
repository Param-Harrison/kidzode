In computer science, we often need to keep track of a "Global State"—the current value of something important, like your bank balance.

### Instructions:
1. We use a variable `balance` outside our functions.
2. Inside a function, we must use `global balance` if we want to change it.
3. Run the code to see how we announce the current balance!
