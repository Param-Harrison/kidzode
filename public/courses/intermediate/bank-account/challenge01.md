# CHALLENGE: Interest Calculator 📈

Can you write a function that calculates how much interest your money should earn?

### Your Task:
1. Create a function `add_interest(rate)`.
2. The `rate` should be a decimal (like 0.05 for 5%).
3. Calculate `interest = balance * rate`.
4. Add the interest to your balance.

### Engineering Challenge:
Can you make the function **RETURN** the interest amount so you can print specifically how much you earned?

Good luck, Banker!
