# CHALLENGE 3: Daily Limit 🛑

Banks have limits! Can you stop a withdrawal if it's too big?

### Your Task:
1. Create a variable `limit = 50`.
2. Write a `withdraw(amount)` function.
3. Check IF `amount > limit` OR `amount > balance`.
4. If either is true, print "Transaction Denied!".
5. Otherwise, give the money.

### Achievement:
You've built a multi-check security system! 🛡️
