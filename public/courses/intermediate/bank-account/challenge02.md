# Challenge 2: Transfer Money 💸

## Your Mission
Create a function to transfer money between two accounts!

## Your Task
1. Create two balances: `savings = 500` and `checking = 100`
2. Create `transfer(amount)` that moves money from savings to checking  
3. Use safety checks — can't transfer more than you have!

**Example:**
```
Savings: $500, Checking: $100
Transfer $200...
Savings: $300, Checking: $300
```

Move that money! 💸
