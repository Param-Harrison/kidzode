# Safety Checks 🛑

A good engineer always considers what can go wrong. What if you try to withdraw more money than you have?

### Instructions:
1. We add an `if` statement to check if `amount > balance`.
2. If it is, we show an error instead of letting the balance go below zero.
3. Run the code to see the safety check in action.

### Achievement:
You've learned defensive programming—writing code that doesn't break! 🛡️
