# The Character Bank 🏦

## Your Mission
Security is super important online! Today we're building a tool that creates strong, random passwords to keep accounts safe.

## What Makes a Strong Password?
A strong password has:
- Letters (both lower and UPPER case)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Symbols (!@#$%^&*)
- At least 8 characters

## Our Character Bank
We need a "bank" of all possible characters to pick from:

```python
chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%"
```

This is like a bag of letters, numbers, and symbols. Later, we'll reach in and grab random ones!

## Try It!
1. Run the code to see our character bank
2. Count how many different characters we have
3. Think about how many combinations are possible!

## What You Learned
✅ Strong passwords mix letters, numbers, and symbols
✅ We store all possible characters in one long string
✅ This is our "ingredient list" for passwords

## Coming Up Next
We'll randomly pick characters to build a password! 🔐
