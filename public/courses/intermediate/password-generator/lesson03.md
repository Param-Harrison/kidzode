# Joining the Pieces 🛠️

In Python, there's actually a faster way to join characters together. Instead of using a loop with `+`, we can use `.join()`.

### Instructions:
1. We still pick characters, but we do it inside a "list comprehension" (a Python shortcut).
2. `"".join()` sticks them all together.
3. Run the code to see this professional way of doing it!

### Achievement:
You've learned a "Pythonic" shorthand for joining data! 🚀
