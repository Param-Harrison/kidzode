# Looping a Password ➰

To build a password of a certain length (like 8 characters), we need to run a loop 8 times and pick a character each time.

### Instructions:
1. We start with an empty string: `password = ""`.
2. Inside the loop, we pick a random character and add it to the string.
3. Run the code to see a random sequence generated!

### Achievement:
You've learned how to "accumulate" data inside a loop! 💎
