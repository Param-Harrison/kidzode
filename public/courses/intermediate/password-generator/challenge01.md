# CHALLENGE: Super Secure 🏆

Can you create a tool that asks the user how long their password should be?

### Your Task:
1. Ask the user for the length (e.g., "Enter password length:").
2. Convert that input to a number.
3. Use a loop to pick characters.
4. Print the final password!

### Extra Engineering:
Can you add a message that says "STRENGTH: STRONG" if the length is 10 or more?

Good luck, Engineer!
