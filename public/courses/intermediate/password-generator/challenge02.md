# Challenge 2: PIN Code Maker 🔢

## Your Mission
Some systems only use numbers (like ATM PINs). Create a 4-digit PIN generator!

## Your Task
1. Create a number-only character bank: `"0123456789"`
2. Start with an empty PIN
3. Loop 4 times to pick 4 random digits
4. Print the PIN

**Example output:**
```
Your secure PIN is: 7291
```

## Hint
It's the same as passwords, but digits only!

Secure those numbers! 🔐
