# CHALLENGE 2: PIN Code Maker 🔢

Passwords are good, but some systems only use numbers! Let's build a 4-digit PIN generator.

### Your Task:
1. Create a variable `numbers = "0123456789"`.
2. Create an empty `pin` string.
3. Use a loop that runs 4 times.
4. Pick a random number from your string and add it to `pin`.
5. Print the result: "Your secure PIN is: [PIN]".

### Achievement:
You've engineered a numeric security tool! 🔐
