# Final Scoreboard 🏆

Now let's loop through our whole quiz data and use a `score` variable to track points.

### Instructions:
1. We start with `score = 0`.
2. For each question dictionary, we run our `ask` function.
3. If the function returns `True`, we add 1 to the score.
4. Run the code for a full quiz experience!

### Achievement:
You've built a complete interactive application from scratch! 🎮
