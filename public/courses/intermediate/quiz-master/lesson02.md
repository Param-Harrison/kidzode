# Reusable Questions 🔄

Instead of writing `input()` for every question, let's write a **Function** that handles "asking" any question.

### Instructions:
1. Our function `ask(question, correct_answer)` takes two parameters.
2. It returns `True` if the user is right, and `False` if they are wrong.
3. Run the code to see our engine in action!

### Achievement:
You've engineered a "black box"—a function that does one job perfectly! 📦
