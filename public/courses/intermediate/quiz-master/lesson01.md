# The Quiz Bank 🏦

To build a professional quiz, we need a way to store our questions and answers. We can use a **List of Dictionaries**.

### Instructions:
1. Each item in the list is a dictionary with `question` and `answer`.
2. This makes it easy to add more questions later without changing our code "brain".
3. Run the code to see how we access the first question.

### Achievement:
You've learned how to combine Lists and Dictionaries for powerful data storage! 🧪
