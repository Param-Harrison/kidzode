# Challenge 2: Priority Tasks ⚡

## Your Mission
Add priority labels to your tasks!

## Your Task
1. When adding a task, also ask for priority (High or Normal)
2. Store it as "[HIGH] Task" or "[NORMAL] Task"
3. Show the priority when viewing tasks

**Example:**
```
What task? Clean room
Priority (High/Normal)? High
Your Tasks:
- [HIGH] Clean room
```

## Hint
Combine the priority with the task using `+`:
```python
full_task = "[" + priority + "] " + task
```

Prioritize! ⚡
