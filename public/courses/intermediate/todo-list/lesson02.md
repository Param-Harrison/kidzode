# The Main Menu Loop 🔄

A real app keeps running until you tell it to stop. We use a `while True:` loop to keep our app alive!

### Instructions:
1. The loop runs forever... unless we use `break`.
2. We ask the user for their choice and use `if/elif` to decide what to do.
3. Run the code and try typing '3' to exit.

### Achievement:
You've built a program that stays active and waits for your commands! 🕹️
