# Organizing with Functions 📂

Software engineers use **Functions** to organize their code into reusable blocks. Think of a function like a recipe that you can follow whenever you need it.

### Instructions:
1. We use `def show_menu():` to create a new "recipe".
2. We call it using `show_menu()` to make it happen.
3. Run the code to see how functions help keep things tidy!

### Achievement:
You've learned the building blocks of professional code organization! 🏗️
