# Organizing with Functions 📝

## Your Mission
Getting things done feels great! Today we're building a to-do list app to stay organized.

## What's a Function?
A **function** is a reusable piece of code with a name. Think of it like a recipe card — you write it once, then use it whenever you need it!

## How to Create a Function
```python
def show_menu():
    print("1. Add Task")
    print("2. View Tasks")
    print("3. Exit")
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `def` = "define" (we're creating something new)
- `show_menu` = the name of our function
- `()` = where info can go in (we'll learn this later!)
- `:` = start the recipe

## How to Use It
Just call its name with `()`:
```python
show_menu()
```

Now all those print lines run! And you can call it again and again.

## Try It!
1. Run the code — the menu shows twice!
2. Edit the function to add a 4th option
3. Notice how BOTH menus change when you edit ONCE!

## What You Learned
✅ `def name():` creates a function
✅ Indented code belongs to the function
✅ Call it with `name()` to run it
✅ Write once, use many times! 🔄
