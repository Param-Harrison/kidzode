# The Data Map 🗺️

A **Dictionary** is a way to store data in pairs: a "Key" and a "Value". It's like a real dictionary where you look up a word (the key) to find its definition (the value).

### Instructions:
1. Dictionaries use curly brackets `{}`.
2. We look up a value using its key: `weather["London"]`.
3. Run the code to see how we store city weather!
