# The Data Map 🗺️

## Your Mission
Is it sunny or rainy? Today we're building a weather reporter that stores and looks up weather for different cities!

## What's a Dictionary?
A **dictionary** stores data in pairs: a **key** and a **value**. Think of it like a contact list:
- The NAME (key) helps you find the PHONE NUMBER (value)

## How It Looks
```python
weather = {
    "London": "Rainy",
    "Tokyo": "Sunny",
    "Paris": "Cloudy"
}
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `{}` = curly brackets for dictionaries
- `"London": "Rainy"` = key: value pair
- Pairs are separated by commas

## Looking Up Values
Use the key to find the value:
```python
weather["London"]  # Returns: "Rainy"
```

Like looking up a phone number by name!

## Try It!
1. Run the code
2. Look up weather for Tokyo
3. Add a new city!

## What You Learned
✅ Dictionaries use `{key: value}` format
✅ Look up with `dictionary["key"]`
✅ Perfect for storing related information!
