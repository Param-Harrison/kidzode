# CHALLENGE: Global Weather 🏆

Can you build a report that shows the weather for ALL cities in your dictionary?

### Your Task:
1. Create a dictionary with at least 3 cities.
2. Use a loop to look at each city.
3. Print a clean report for each one.

### Engineering Challenge:
Use `cities.items()` in your loop to get both the **name** and the **info** at the same time!

Good luck, Meteorologist!
