# City Lookup 🔎

What happens if a user looks up a city that isn't in our dictionary? The app might crash! We need to check if the key exists first.

### Instructions:
1. We use `if city in cities:` to check.
2. If it's not there, we show a friendly message.
3. Run the code and try searching for a city that doesn't exist.

### Achievement:
You've built a robust tool that handles missing data gracefully! 🛡️
