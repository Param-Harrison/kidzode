Dictionaries can even hold *other* dictionaries! This is how we store complex information about a city.

2. To find the temperature, we use `weather["London"]["temp"]`.
3. Run the code to see detailed weather info.

### Achievement:
You've learned how to organize "Nested Data"—the way real apps handle info! 📦
