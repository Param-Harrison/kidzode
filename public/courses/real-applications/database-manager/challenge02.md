# Mini-Challenge 2: Manage Users

Here is your database:
```python
db = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Iron Man", "active": True},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Ultron", "active": True}
]
```

**Your Goal:**
1. Update "Iron Man" to `active: False` (he retired).
2. Delete "Ultron" entirely (he was destroyed).
3. Print the final database.
