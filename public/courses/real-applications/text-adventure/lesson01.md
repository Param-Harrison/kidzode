# Welcome to the Dungeon 🏰

Before graphics, games were text.
**Interactive Fiction (IF)** is about reading and typing.

It’s just a conversation with the computer!

```python
print("You are standing in a dark forest.")
print("To the north you see a light.")

action = input("What do you do? > ")

if action == "go north":
    print("You walk towards the light...")
else:
    print("You stay in the dark.")
```

Simple `print` and `input`. That's the engine! 🚂
