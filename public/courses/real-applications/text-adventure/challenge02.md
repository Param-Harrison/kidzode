# Mini-Challenge 2: Scavenger Hunt 🗝️

Object-Oriented Dungeon!

**Setup:**
1. `Room` class.
2. `Item` class.
3. `Player` class (with inventory).

**Map:**
1. **Start**: Has nothing. Goes North.
2. **Hall**: Has "Coin". Goes South (Start) or East (Vault).
3. **Vault**: Locked! Needs "Key".

**Goal:**
- Implement `get <item>`.
- Implement `inventory` (list items).
- You can't win until you find the Key (Wait... where is the key? Add a 3rd room "Cell"!).

Go fetch!
