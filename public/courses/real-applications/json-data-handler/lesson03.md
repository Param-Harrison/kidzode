# The JSON Module

Python has a built-in tool called `json` to handle this data.

We need to `import` it first!

```python
import json

print("JSON module loaded!")
```

You'll see:
```
JSON module loaded!
```

We don't do anything with it yet, but now we have the power! ⚡️

## Try This!
Import the `random` module too!
