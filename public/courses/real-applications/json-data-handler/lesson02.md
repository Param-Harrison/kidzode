# JSON vs Python Dict

They look the same, but they are different!

A **Python Dictionary** is code inside Python.
**JSON** is just text (a string) that looks like a dictionary.

```python
# Python Dictionary
hero = {"name": "Batman"} 

# JSON String (notice the outside quotes!)
hero_json = '{"name": "Batman"}'

print(hero)
print(hero_json)
```

You'll see:
```
{'name': 'Batman'}
{"name": "Batman"}
```

## Try This!
Create a JSON string for: `{"food": "Pizza"}`
