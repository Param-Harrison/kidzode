# Different Stats 📊

We can pass different values to `__init__`.
This makes each Hero unique from birth!

### The Setup
```python
def __init__(self, role):
    self.role = role
```

### Your Goal
1. Define `class Hero`.
2. Init takes `name` and `job` (e.g. "Warrior").
3. Create `h1` as "Arthur", "Knight".
4. Create `h2` as "Merlin", "Wizard".
5. Print both jobs.
