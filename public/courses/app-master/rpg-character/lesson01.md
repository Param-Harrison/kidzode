# Multiple Instances 👥

The power of classes: Code ONE blueprint, build MANY objects.
Each object is called an **Instance**.
They act independently!

### The Logic
```python
p1 = Player()
p2 = Player()
p1.score = 10 
# p2.score is still 0!
```

### Your Goal
1. Define `class Hero` with `self.hp = 100`.
2. Create two heroes: `h1` and `h2`.
3. Change `h1.hp` to 50.
4. Print both h1 and h2 HP. See the difference?

### Achievement
👥 **Cloner**: You replicated your code logic!
