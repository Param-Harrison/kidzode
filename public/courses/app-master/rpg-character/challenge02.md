# CHALLENGE 2: Level Up

Add a method to increase level.
`__init__` sets the starting level, but methods change it.

### Your Task:
1. `class Role` with `__init__(self, name)` and `self.level = 1` (default).
2. method `levelup(self)`: increase level by 1.
3. Create "Sniper". Call levelup 3 times.
4. Print final level.

### Practical Use
Progression systems rely on internal state management like this.
