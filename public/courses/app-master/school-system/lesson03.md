# Nested Methods 🐢

To add a student to a room inside a school, we drill down.
`school.rooms[0].add_student(...)`

### The Code
```python
# Accessing
my_school.rooms[0].add_student("Alice")
```

### Your Goal
1. `class Garage` with `cars = []`.
2. `class Car` with `wheels = 4`.
3. Create Garage. Add Car.
4. Access the car inside garage: `g.cars[0]`.
5. Print its wheels.

### Practical Use
`document.body.div.button.click()`. The most common pattern in web development.
