# Nested Methods 🐢

To add a student to a room inside a school, we drill down.
`school.rooms[0].add_student(...)`

### The Code
```python
# Accessing
my_school.rooms[0].add_student("Alice")
```

### Your Goal
1. `class Classroom` with `students = []`.
2. `class Student` with `grade = 1`.
3. Create Classroom. Add Student.
4. Access the student inside classroom: `c.students[0]`.
5. Print its grade.

### Practical Use
`document.body.div.button.click()`. The most common pattern in web development.
