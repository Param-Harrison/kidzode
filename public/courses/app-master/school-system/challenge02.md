# CHALLENGE 2: Find Student

Search for a student by name.
Return "Found" or "Not Found".

### Your Task:
1. `class Classroom` with `find(name)` method.
2. Loop through `self.students`.
3. If `s.name == name`, return True.
4. If loop finishes, return False.
5. Add "Jim". Search for "Jim" (True) and "Pam" (False).

### Practical Use
Searching is "O(n)" complexity (checking every item). Smart databases use indexes, but keeping it simple is fine for now!
