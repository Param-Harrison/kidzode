# Moving Objects 🚗

Cars move forward.
We track their position.

### The Logic
```python
def move(self):
    self.pos += 1
```

### Your Goal
1. Define `Car` with `position = 0`.
2. Add `drive(self)`. Increases pos by 10.
3. Create car. Call drive twice. Print pos.

### Achievement
🚗 **Driver**: You set things in motion!
