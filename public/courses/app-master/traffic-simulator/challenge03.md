# CHALLENGE 3: Crash Detection

Did two cars hit each other?
Check if their positions are equal.

### Your Task:
1. `c1` at `x=10`.
2. `c2` at `x=10`.
3. Check `if c1.x == c2.x`.
4. If true, print "CRASH!".

### Practical Use
Collision Detection is complex geometry math, but fundamentally it just checks if two objects occupy the same space.
