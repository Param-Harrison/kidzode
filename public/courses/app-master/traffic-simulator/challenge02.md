# CHALLENGE 2: Smart Light

The traffic light should control the cars!
If light is "Red", cars stop (speed becomes 0).

### Your Task:
1. `class Car` with `speed` and `stop()`.
2. `stop()` sets speed to 0.
3. `class Light` with color.
4. If Light is "Red", call `car.stop()`.
5. Verify car speed is 0.

### Practical Use
Traffic logic involves objects communicating states. Light -> Car -> Stop.
