# CHALLENGE 1: Fast Cars

Different cars have different speeds.
Some move faster per tick.

### Your Task:
1. `class Car` with `__init__(self, speed)`. `x = 0`.
2. `move(self)` adds speed to x.
3. Create fast car (10) and slow car (2).
4. Move both.
5. Print positions.

### Practical Use
Racing games balance cars by tweaking these speed parameters.
