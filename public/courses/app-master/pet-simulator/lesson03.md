# Actions (Methods) 🏃

Objects can DO things.
Functions inside classes are called **Methods**.
They always take `self` as the first argument.

### The Syntax
```python
class Dog:
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")
```

### Your Goal
1. Define `class Pet`.
2. Add a method `speak(self)`.
3. Inside, print "Hello!".
4. Create a pet and call `pet.speak()`.

### Achievement
🏃 **Trainer**: You taught your pet a trick!
