# CHALLENGE 1: Feeding Time

Make the pet eat!
Eating should decrease hunger.
Use `self.hunger` to access internal state.

### Your Task:
1. Define `Pet` class with `hunger = 50`.
2. Add method `eat(self)`.
3. Inside, `self.hunger -= 10`.
4. Create pet, print hunger, call `eat()`, print hunger.

### Practical Use
This allows items (Potions, Food) to affect player stats in games.
