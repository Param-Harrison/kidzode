# CHALLENGE 2: Sleepy Pet

When a pet sleeps, Energy goes UP.
But... don't let it go over 100! (Max energy).

### Your Task:
1. `Pet` with `energy = 80`.
2. `sleep(self)`: adds 50 to energy.
3. If energy > 100, set it to 100.
4. Test it.

### Practical Use
Refilling health bars at a save point usually caps at the maximum value.
