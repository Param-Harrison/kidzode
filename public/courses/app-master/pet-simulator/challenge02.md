# CHALLENGE 2: Energy Meter 🔋

Pets get tired!
We need a **State** that changes.

### Your Task:
1. In `__init__`, set `self.energy = 10`.
2. Add a method `play(self)`.
3. Inside `play`, subtract 5 from energy (`self.energy -= 5`).
4. Print "Played! Energy is [energy]".
5. Create pet and call `play()` twice.

### Achievement:
You implemented mutable state! ⚡
