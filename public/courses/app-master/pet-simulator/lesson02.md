# Pet State (Attributes) 📊

State is what makes your pet unique.
Is it hungry? Is it happy?
We call these "Attributes".

### The Code
```python
class Pet:
    energy = 100
    hunger = 0

buddy = Pet()
buddy.energy = 50 
```

### Your Goal
1. Define class `VirtualPet`.
2. Add `happiness = 50`.
3. Create `p1`. Set its `happiness` to 100.
4. Create `p2` (leave default).
5. Print both.

### Practical Use
In games, "Health Points" (HP) and "Mana" are just attributes on the Player object.
