# CHALLENGE 3: Playful Mood

Playing affects TWO variables.
Fun goes UP, but Energy goes DOWN.

### Your Task:
1. `Pet` with `fun = 0` and `energy = 100`.
2. `play(self)`: fun +20, energy -10.
3. Call it 3 times.
4. Print final stats.

### Practical Use
Game mechanics are about balancing tradeoffs (e.g., Sprinting makes you faster but uses stamina).
