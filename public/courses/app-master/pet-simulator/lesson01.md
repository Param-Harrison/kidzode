# The Blueprint (Class) 🏗️

A **Class** is a blueprint.
It tells Python how to build an object.
It's like a plan for a house.

### The Syntax
We use the keyword `class` and `Capitalize` the name.

```python
class Robot:
    pass # Empty blueprint
```

### Your Goal
1. Define a class named `Pet`.
2. Inside, put `pass`.
3. Create an object `my_pet = Pet()`.
4. Print `my_pet`.

### Achievement
🏗️ **Architect**: You designed your first software object!
