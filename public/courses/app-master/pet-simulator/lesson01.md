# The Blueprint (Class) 🏗️

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) lets us create our own Types.
A **Class** is a Blueprint (Template).
An **Object** is the real thing built from that blueprint.

### The Code
```python
class Robot:
    name = "Bot"

# Build one!
my_bot = Robot()
print(my_bot.name)
```

### Your Goal
1. Define class `Dog`.
2. Inside, set variable `sound = "Woof"`.
3. Create `my_dog = Dog()`.
4. Print `my_dog.sound`.

### Practical Use
Every element in a video game (Player, Enemy, Bullet) is an Object built from a Class.
