# CHALLENGE 1: Transfer Funds

Move money from Account A to Account B.
You need TWO objects.

### Your Task:
1. `class Bank` with `balance`. `__init__` sets balance.
2. `transfer(self, target_account, amount)`.
3. Deduct from self, add to target_account.
4. Create `a1` (100) and `a2` (0).
5. `a1.transfer(a2, 50)`.
6. Print both.

### Practical Use
This is exactly how Zelle/Venmo work under the hood.
