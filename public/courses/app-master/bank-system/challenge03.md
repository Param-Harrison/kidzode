# CHALLENGE 3: Activity Log

Keep a history of transactions.
Store strings in a list inside the object.

### Your Task:
1. `__init__` sets `self.history = []`.
2. `log(self, msg)` appends to history.
3. Call `log("Deposited 10")`.
4. Call `log("Withdrew 5")`.
5. Print `history`.

### Practical Use
Audit logs are legally required for banking software.
