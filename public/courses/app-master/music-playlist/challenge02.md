# CHALLENGE 2: Remove Song

Delete a song by title.
Loop to find it, then `remove()`.

### Your Task:
1. `class Playlist` with `remove(title)`.
2. Loop through `self.songs`.
3. If `song.title == title`: `self.songs.remove(song)`.
4. Add "A" and "B". Remove "A". Check list.

### Practical Use
Managing playlists requires full CRUD capabilities.
