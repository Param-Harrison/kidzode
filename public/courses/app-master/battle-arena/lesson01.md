# The Fighter Class 🥋

Let's build a Street Fighter style game.
Each fighter needs a Name and HP.

### The Setup
```python
class Fighter:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.hp = 100
```

### Your Goal
1. Define `class Fighter`.
2. Init takes `name`. Set `hp` to 100.
3. Create `ryu = Fighter("Ryu")`.
4. Create `ken = Fighter("Ken")`.
5. Print both names.

### Achievement
🥋 **Black Belt**: You initialized the combatants!
