# CHALLENGE 1: Healing

Add a `heal()` method.
It should increase `hp`.
But max HP cap is optional for now.

### Your Task:
1. `class Mage` with `hp=50`.
2. `heal(self)` adds 20 to hp.
3. Mage takes 30 damage. Then heals.
4. Print final hp.

### Practical Use
The "Healer" class in games often just reverses the math of the "Warrior" class.
