# The Filter 🧹

Searching is good, but we want to **move** items into a new bag.
We can create a new list and `append` only the items we want!

### The Algorithm
1. Create an empty list: `my_food = []`.
2. Loop through the backpack.
3. If it's food, add it to `my_food`.
4. Ignore everything else.

### Your Goal
1. Create a backpack with mixed items.
2. Create an empty `food_bag`.
3. Loop and filter.
4. Print the final `food_bag`.

### Achievement
🥤 **Data Filter**: You cleaned your dataset!
