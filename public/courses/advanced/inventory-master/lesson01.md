## Welcome to Inventory Master! 🎒
Every great adventurer needs a way to manage their loot. Let's build a smart backpack that tracks your items, weapons, and magical potions!

# The Inventory 🎒

You are an adventurer in a fantasy world.
You pick up many items, and you need a way to organize them.
Let's make a **List of Dictionaries** again!

### The Data
Each item has a `name` and a `type`.
```python
backpack = [
  {"name": "Apple", "type": "Food"},
  {"name": "Sword", "type": "Weapon"}
]
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a `backpack` list with 3 items.
2. Give them different types (Food, Weapon, Potion).
3. Print the inventory.

### Achievement
🎒 **Pack Mule**: You organized your loot!
