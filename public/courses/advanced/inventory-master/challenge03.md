# Challenge: The Ultimate Deal 💰

## Your Mission
A traveling merchant wants to buy your items! 🛒 But he only buys items that are **Rare** and cost **less than 50 gold**.

## Your Task
1. Look at the `merchant_list` (a list of dictionaries).
2. Create a list called `sale_items`.
3. Loop through the list.
4. Use `if` with **`and`** to check two things:
   - Is the item's type `"Rare"`?
   - Is its price `< 50`?
5. If both are True, add the item's name to your sale list.
6. Print: `"Items to sell: [sale_items]"`

**Pro Tip:** This is exactly how shopping filters on websites like Amazon work! 🛍️
