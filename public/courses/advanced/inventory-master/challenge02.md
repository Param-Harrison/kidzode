# Challenge: Junk Removal 🚮

## Your Mission
Sir Codes-A-Lot's backpack is heavy! 🎒 We need to remove anything that contains the word **"Broken"**.

## Your Task
1. Look at the `backpack` list.
2. Create a new list called `shiny_inventory`.
3. Loop through the backpack.
4. If an item **does not** contain the word "Broken", add it to the new list.
5. Print: `"Clean Inventory: [shiny_inventory]"`

**Detective Tip:** Use `if "Broken" not in item:` to keep only the good stuff!
