# Challenge: Quest Items 📜

## Your Mission
The King has requested 3 specific items for a royal quest: a **Crown**, a **Ring**, and a **Cape**. Do you have them in your storage? 🏰

## Your Task
1. Look at the `storage` list.
2. Create a list called `missing_items`.
3. Check for the `"Crown"`, `"Ring"`, and `"Cape"`.
4. If an item is NOT in the storage, add it to `missing_items`.
5. Print: `"You still need to find: [missing_items]"`

**Hint:** You can use `if "Crown" not in storage:` to find what's missing!
