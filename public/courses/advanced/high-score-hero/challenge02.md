# CHALLENGE 2: Average Score 📊

The "Average" tells us how good the team is overall.
To find it, we need two steps:
1. Find the **Total** (`sum`).
2. Divide by the **Count** (`len`).

### Your Task:
1. Create a list of 3 scores.
2. Calculate total using `sum()`.
3. Calculate count using `len()`.
4. Calculate average: `total / count`.
5. Print it!

### Achievement:
You calculated a Mean value! 🧠
