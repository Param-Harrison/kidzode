# The Scoreboard 🏆

## Your Mission
Welcome to the big leagues, Hero! 🦸‍♂️ You’ve been hired as the lead developer for "Kidzode Games." Your first task? Building the logic for the ultimate High Score Board. We have thousands of players, and we need to handle their scores like a pro.

## Lists of Numbers
In your Foundation training, you used lists for names like `["Alice", "Bob"]`. In the Advanced world, we use lists to store **Data**—like numbers!

```python
scores = [450, 780, 120, 990, 560]
```

## The "Math Magic" Tools 🪄
Python has built-in superpowers to look at a list of numbers and give you instant answers. 

1. **`max(scores)`**: Finds the highest number (The Winner!).
2. **`min(scores)`**: Finds the lowest number (The Newbie!).
3. **`sum(scores)`**: Adds every single number together.

## Try It!
1. Check the `scores` list on the right.
2. Click **Run** to see the "Math Magic" in action.
3. **Experiment:** Change one of the scores to a huge number like `1000000`. Run it again. Who is the winner now?

## What You Learned
✅ Lists can store numbers just as easily as names.
✅ **`max()`**, **`min()`**, and **`sum()`** are "Shortcut" tools that save you from writing long loops.
✅ These tools make you a much faster coder!

## Fun Fact
Data Analysts at companies like YouTube use `max()` and `sum()` every day to see which videos are the most popular! 📈
