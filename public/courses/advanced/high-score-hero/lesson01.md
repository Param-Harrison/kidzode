# Welcome to High Score Hero! 🏆
Who is the ultimate champion? Let's build a pro-level scoreboard that can find the winners and analyze game stats like a real data scientist!

## The Scoreboard 🏆

To find a winner, we need a list of numbers.
In Data Science, this is called a **Numerical Dataset**.

### Numbers Only
A list can hold just numbers:
```python
scores = [10, 50, 99, 25]
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a list called `scores` with 4 numbers.
2. Print the list to see your data.
3. Add an Achievement badge to your investigation log.

### Achievement
🔢 **Number Cruncher**: You crunched the raw data!
