# Challenge: Top 3 Rankings 🥉

## Your Mission
The tournament is over! 🏁 We need to show the **Top 3 Scores** on the big screen. 

## Your Task
1. Use the `tournament_scores` list.
2. Use `.sort()` to put them in order.
3. Since `.sort()` puts the smallest first, the biggest will be at the **End**.
4. Use **Negative Indexing** to print the last three items:
   - `print("1st Place:", tournament_scores[-1])`
   - `print("2nd Place:", tournament_scores[-2])`
   - `print("3rd Place:", tournament_scores[-3])`

**Pro Tip:** Negative indexing is like counting backward from the end of the line! `-1` is always the very last item.
