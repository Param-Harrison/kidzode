# CHALLENGE 3: Top 3 🏅

We need to sort the scores from highest to lowest.
Python has a function called `sorted()`.

### The Trick
By default, Python sorts smallest to biggest.
To reverse it, we say: `sorted(scores, reverse=True)`.

### Your Task:
1. Create a list of 5 scores (mixed up).
2. Sort them using `sorted(scores, reverse=True)`.
3. Print the sorted list.
4. (Bonus) Print the Top 3 items using `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`.

### Achievement:
You've organized a chaotic dataset! 📂
