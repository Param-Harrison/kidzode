# Team Score 🤝

Sometimes we want to know the **Total** score of the whole team.
We need to add all the numbers together.

### The Tool: sum()
The `sum()` function adds up everything in a list.

```python
total = sum(scores)
print(total)
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a list of 3 scores.
2. Calculate the `total`.
3. Print: "Team Total: [number]".
