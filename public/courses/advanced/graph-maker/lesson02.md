# Drawing Bars 🧱

How do we draw with text? We use symbols!
In Python, we can multiply strings.

### The Magic
`"*" * 5` becomes `"*****"`.

```python
score = 3
bar = "*" * score
print(bar)
# Prints: ***
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a variable `val = 8`.
2. Create a bar using `"*"` multiplied by `val`.
3. Print the bar.

### Achievement
🎨 **ASCII Artist**: You turned a number into a picture!
