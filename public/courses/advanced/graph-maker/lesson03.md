# Full Chart 📊

One bar is nice, but a **Chart** compares multiple values.
We iterate through our data list and print a bar for each number.

### The Loop
```python
for score in goals:
    print("*" * score)
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a definition list `data = [2, 5, 3, 8]`.
2. Print "--- MY GRAPH ---".
3. Loop through the list.
4. Print a bar for each number.

### Achievement
📉 **Data Analyst**: You visualized an entire dataset!
