# CHALLENGE 1: Labelled Chart 🏷️

A chart is useless if we don't know what it means!
Let's add labels using a **List of Dictionaries**.

### Your Task:
1. Create a list: `stats = [{"name": "Mon", "val": 2}, {"name": "Tue", "val": 5}]`.
2. Loop through the list.
3. Print the name, a colon `:`, and then the bar `*`.

### Achievement:
You created a readable, professional graph! 📋
