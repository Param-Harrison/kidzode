# Challenge: Ultimate Data Pro 💎

## Your Mission
You've been asked to graph the height of the world's tallest buildings! 🏙️ These buildings are hundreds of meters tall, so you'll need to use your **Scaling** skills.

## Your Task
1. Use the `buildings` list of dictionaries (Name and Height).
2. Use a scale where **1 block = 50 meters**.
3. Loop through the list.
4. Calculate the `scaled_height` for each building (Height // 50).
5. Print the name and the scaled bar.
6. Print a **Legend** at the bottom: `"Scale: Each █ = 50m"`

**Bonus:** Can you print the total height of all buildings combined?
