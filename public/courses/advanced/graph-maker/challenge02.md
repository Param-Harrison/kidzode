# Challenge: Weather Tracker ☀️

## Your Mission
The local news needs a **Temperature Chart** for the week. 🌡️

## Your Task
1. Look at the `temps` list (like `[22, 25, 19, 30, 28]`).
2. Loop through the list.
3. Instead of a solid block, use the degree symbol `*` to draw the bars.
4. If a temperature is **above 28**, print "HOT!" next to the bar.
5. Print: `"Weekly High: [Max Temp]"`

**Hint:** Use `max(temps)` to find the high!
