# CHALLENGE 2: Scaled Graph 📏

The numbers are too big! If we have 100, the bar will break the screen.
We need to **Scale Down**.

### The Math
If we divide the value by 10, then `100` becomes `10` stars.
Use integer division `//` to avoid decimals.

### Your Task:
1. Create `data = [50, 20, 80]`.
2. Loop through data.
3. Calculate `stars = num // 10`.
4. Print the bar.

### Achievement:
You implemented data normalization! 📉
