# The Data Set 📊

To make a graph, we need numbers.
Let's store the number of goals scored by our team in the last 4 games.

### The List
```python
goals = [3, 1, 5, 2]
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a `data` list with 5 numbers between 1 and 10.
2. Print the list.
3. This is the raw data we will visualize!
