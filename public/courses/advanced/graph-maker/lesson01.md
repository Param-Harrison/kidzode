# The Data Artist 🎨

## Your Mission
Numbers are boring to look at. 😴 If you tell someone "Sales are 50," they might yawn. but if you show them a **Giant Bar** that fills the screen, they’ll say "WOW!" Your mission is to turn boring numbers into beautiful ASCII art charts.

## String Multiplication
Did you know you can "multiply" text in Python? It’s like using a rubber stamp! 🧱

```python
# Stamps 10 bricks in a row
bar = "█" * 10
print(bar)  # Shows: ██████████
```

## The Bar Chart Rule
To turn a number into a bar, we just multiply a symbol by that number:
```python
score = 15
print("Score:", "█" * score)
```

## Try It!
1. Check the `sales` variable on the right.
2. Click **Run** to see the bar appear.
3. **Experiment:** Change the `sales` to `50`. Does the bar grow?

## What You Learned
✅ You can use the asterisk `*` to repeat a string many times.
✅ This is the secret to building "Text-Based Graphics."
✅ This is how old-school computers (from the 80s!) showed graphs.

## Fun Fact
Before high-resolution screens existed, NASA scientists used strings of characters to draw the first pictures of Mars! 🚀
