# Challenge: Classic Movies 🎞️

## Your Mission
A user wants to watch a "Classic." In our vault, a classic is any movie made **before the year 2010**. 🕰️

## Your Task
1. Look at the `movie_vault` (each movie now has a `"year"` key).
2. Create a list called `classics`.
3. Loop through the vault.
4. If the movie's year is **less than 2010**, add its title to the list.
5. Print: `"Classic Discoveries: [classics]"`

**Hint:** Use `if movie["year"] < 2010:`
