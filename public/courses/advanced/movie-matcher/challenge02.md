# Challenge: Search Bar 🔍

## Your Mission
Users don't always remember the full title. They might just type "Spider" or "Star." 🌟 We need a search bar that finds any movie where the search text is **hidden inside** the title.

## Your Task
1. Use the `search_text` variable.
2. Loop through your `movies` list.
3. Check if the `search_text` is **in** the movie's title.
4. If it is, print: `"Found match: [title]"`

**Pro Tip:** Remember the `in` shortcut from the Inventory project? It works on strings too! `if "Star" in "Star Wars":` is True.
