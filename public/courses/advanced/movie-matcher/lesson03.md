# Smart Recommender 🧠

Sometimes we have two conditions.
"I want a Comedy AND it must be popular."

### The Logic: AND
In Python, we use the `and` keyword.

```python
if genre == "Comedy" and rating > 8:
    print("Watch this!")
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a list of movies with `genre` and `rating` (1-10).
2. Ask the user for a genre.
3. Loop through the list.
4. If genre matches AND rating is greater than 8, print "Highly Recommended!".
