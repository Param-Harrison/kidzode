## Welcome to Movie Matcher! 🎬
Stuck on what to watch? We're going to build a recommendation engine just like Netflix to help you find the perfect movie for your mood!

# The Movie Database 🎬

Netflix uses data to know what you like.
To build our own app, we need a list of movies with details.

### The Data
We need `title` and `genre` (like Comedy, Action, Sci-Fi).

```python
movies = [
  {"title": "Space War", "genre": "Sci-Fi"},
  {"title": "Laugh Out Loud", "genre": "Comedy"}
]
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a `movies` list with 3 movies.
2. Give them a title and a genre.
3. Print the database.

### Achievement
📼 **Media Mogul**: You built a content library!
