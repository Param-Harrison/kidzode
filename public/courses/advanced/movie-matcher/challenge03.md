# Challenge: The Big Winner 🏆

## Your Mission
The "Kidzode Awards" are tonight! 🎤 We need to find the **Single Highest Rated** movie in the entire database to give it the "Movie of the Year" award.

## Your Task
1. Create a variable called `top_movie` and set it to the first movie in the list.
2. Loop through the rest of the movies.
3. If a movie has a higher `rating` than your `top_movie`, update the variable.
4. After the loop, print: `"The Oscar goes to... [title] with a rating of [rating]! 🥳"`

**Reminder:** This is the same logic we used to find the high score in Project 4!
