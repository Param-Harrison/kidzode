# Hints for Random Pick

## 🟢 Hint 1
Make sure to `import random` at the top.

## 🟡 Hint 2
The function is:
```python
pick = random.choice(movies)
```

## 🟠 Hint 3
We simplified this one to use a normal List of strings (instead of dicts) just to make it easy, but `random.choice` works on dicts too!
