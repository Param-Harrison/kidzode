# Genre Search 🔍

If I only want to watch "Comedy", I need to search for it.
We can ask the user what they want!

### The Logic
1. Ask `genre = input(...)`.
2. Loop through movies.
3. IF `item["genre"] == genre`: Print it!

### Your Goal
1. Ask the user: "What genre? (Action/Comedy)".
2. Loop through your movie list.
3. If the genre matches, print the title.

### Achievement
🎯 **Targeting System**: You matched user input to data!
