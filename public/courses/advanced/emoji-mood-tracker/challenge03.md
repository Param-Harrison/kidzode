# Challenge 3: Mood Analyzer 🎭

## Your Mission
It's time for the ultimate AI test! 🧪 You need to build a complete "Mood Analyzer 3000" that takes a message from a user and tells them exactly how they are feeling using Emojis.

## Your Task
1. Get a message from the user using `input()`.
2. Clean the data using `.lower()`.
3. Count at least 3 happy words (like `"great"`, `"yes"`, `"awesome"`).
4. Count at least 3 sad words (like `"bad"`, `"no"`, `"ugh"`).
5. Calculate the `score` (Happy - Sad).
6. Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to print an emoji response!

**Example:**
- Score > 0? Print `"🥳 You sound awesome!"`
- Score < 0? Print `"🥺 Is everything okay?"`
- Score == 0? Print `"😐 Just a normal day!"`
