# The Mood Score ⚖️

Now we have data (counts of emojis).
A Data Scientist uses that data to make a **Decision**.

### The Logic
We can compare the counts!
- If `happy > sad`, the mood is **Positive**.
- If `sad > happy`, the mood is **Negative**.
- Otherwise, it's **Neutral**.

### Your Goal
1. Create a `message` with happy (`😄`) and sad (`😢`) emojis.
2. Count both types.
3. Use an `if/else` block to print the final Mood Report.

### Achievement
🧠 **Sentiment Analyst**: You taught Python to feel!
