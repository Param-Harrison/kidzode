# Challenge 2: Data Cleaner 🧹

## Your Mission
Data is often messy! 😵 Sometimes people write in ALL CAPS or add weird spaces. A good Data Scientist always **cleans** their data before using it. 

## Your Task
1. Use `input()` to get a "messy" message from the user (tell them to use some big letters!).
2. Create a new variable called `cleaned_message`.
3. Use your `.lower()` skill to make the message all tiny letters.
4. Print the result so the user can see their nice, clean data!

**Why it matters:** Computers find it much easier to read "cleaned" data. You're making its life easier! 🤖
