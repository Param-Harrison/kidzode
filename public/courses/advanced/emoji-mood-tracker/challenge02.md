# CHALLENGE 2: Data Cleaner 🧹

Real data is often messy.
Imagine your data has "bad" words that need to be fixed.
Python strings have a `.replace()` method!

### Your Task:
1. Create a variable `text = "I hate bugs!"`.
2. Use `.replace("hate", "love")` to fix the data.
3. Print the new, clean text.

### Achievement:
You've built a data sanitization pipelne! 🛁
