# Counting Feelings 📊

How do we know if a message is Happy or Sad?
We **COUNT** the emojis!

### The Tool: .count()
Python strings have a super power called `.count()`.

```python
msg = "I am so happy! 😄😄"
happy_count = msg.count("😄")
print(happy_count)
# This prints 2
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a `message` with at least 3 happy emojis.
2. Use `.count("😄")` (or any emoji) to see how many there are.
3. Print the result.
