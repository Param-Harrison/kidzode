# CHALLENGE 1: Word Counter 🔢

Data Scientists often need to know how long a text is.
A quick trick to count words is to count the **spaces**!

### Your Task:
1. Ask the user for a sentence.
2. Count the number of spaces `" "`.
3. Add 1 to that number (because the last word doesn't have a space after it).
4. Print: "Word Count: [number]"

### Achievement:
You've engineered a feature extraction algorithm! ⛏️
