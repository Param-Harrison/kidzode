# Challenge: Word Counter 🏆

## Your Mission
You've been hired by a famous author! ✍️ They just wrote a giant book and want to know how many times they used the word `"and"`. You need to build a tool that can count ANY word the user types in.

## Your Task
1. Look at the `message` variable. It's a long sentence.
2. Use `input()` to ask the user: `"Which word should I count?"`
3. Use `.count()` to find that word in the message.
4. Print: `"I found the word [word] [number] times!"`

**Pro Tip:** Use `.lower()` on both the message and the input so the computer doesn't get confused by capital letters! 🔠
