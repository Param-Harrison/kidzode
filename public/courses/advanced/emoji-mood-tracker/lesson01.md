# Text is Data 📜

Welcome to Natural Language Processing (NLP)!
That's a fancy way of saying: "Teaching computers to read."

### The Secret
In Python, a string `"Hello"` is actually just a **LIST of characters**!
- Use `[0]` to get the first letter.
- Use `len()` to count the letters.

### Your Goal
1. Create a variable `message = "Python is cool!"`.
2. Print the first letter `message[0]`.
3. Print the length of the message.

### Achievement
🔬 **Text Scientist**: You see text as data points!
