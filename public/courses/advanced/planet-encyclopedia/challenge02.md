# Challenge 2: Space Travel 🚀

## Your Mission
The Galaxy's biggest tourist company wants to know which planet has the **Most Moons**. They want to take people there for a vacation! 🏝️

## Your Task
1. Use your `planets` database.
2. Create a variable called `best_planet` and set it to the first planet in the list.
3. Use a `for loop` to check every other planet.
4. If a planet has *more* moons than your `best_planet`, update the variable!
