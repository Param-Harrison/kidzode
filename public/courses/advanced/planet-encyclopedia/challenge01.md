# Challenge: Moon Counter 🌙

## Your Mission
A Galactic Council meeting is coming up! 👽 They need to know the **Total Number of Moons** in the entire galaxy. They've given you a list of planets, and it's your job to count 'em all up!

## Your Task
1. Look at the `planets` database. Each planet has a number of `"moons"`.
2. Create a variable called `total_moons` and set it to `0`.
3. Use a `for loop` to go through every planet.
4. Add the number of moons from each planet to your total.
5. Print: `"The Galaxy has a total of [number] moons!"`

**Hint:** Inside the loop, you'll want to do something like:
`total_moons = total_moons + planet["moons"]`
