# Planet Finder 🔭

We have a list of planets. How do we scan them all?
We use a **Loop**!

### The Scan
When you loop through a list of dictionaries, the variable becomes **one dictionary at a time**.

```python
for planet in galaxy:
    # 'planet' is a dictionary here!
    print(planet["name"])
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a `galaxy` list with 2 or more planets.
2. Loop through the galaxy.
3. Print: "Scanning: [Planet Name]" for each one.

### Achievement
📡 **System Scanner**: You can process an entire database!
