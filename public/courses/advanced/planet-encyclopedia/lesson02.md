# The Galaxy Database 🌌

One dictionary is just one planet.
To explore the galaxy, we need a **List of Dictionaries**!

### The Structure
This is how real databases work:
```python
galaxy = [
  {"name": "Mars", "color": "Red"},
  {"name": "Venus", "color": "Yellow"}
]
```

To get the first planet's color:
```python
print(galaxy[0]["color"])
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a list called `planets` with 2 dictionary items inside.
2. Print the entire list.
3. Print specific details from the first planet.

### Achievement
🗄️ **Database Admin**: You created a complex dataset!
