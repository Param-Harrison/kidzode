# Challenge 3: Alien Scanner 👽

## Your Mission
We've detected life signs! 📡 However, life only exists on planets that have **at least 1 moon**. We need an "Alien Scanner" that filters our giant list and only shows us the planets where life might be hiding.

## Your Task
1. Loop through your `planets` list.
2. Use an `if` statement to check if the planet has **more than 0 moons**.
3. If it does, print: `"Scanning [name]... Potential life found! ✅"`
4. If it doesn't have moons, print: `"Scanning [name]... No life detected. ❌"`

## Bonus
Can you count how many "Life Planets" you found in total?
