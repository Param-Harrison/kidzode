# Power Up ⚡

Your character leveled up!
We can change the numbers inside a dictionary.

### The Magic
To add 10 to a value, we use `+= 10`.

```python
hero["attack"] += 10
print(hero["attack"])
# It is now bigger!
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a `player` with 50 `attack`.
2. Print the attack.
3. Add 20 to the attack (Power Up!).
4. Print the new attack.

### Achievement
📈 **Level Up**: You modified your data in place!
