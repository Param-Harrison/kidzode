# Challenge: Level Up! 🆙

## Your Mission
Your team just won a huge quest! 🥇 Every hero in your team gets a **Level Up** bonus.

## Your Task
1. Look at the `hero_team` (a list of dictionaries).
2. Loop through every hero.
3. For each hero:
   - Add 20 to their `health`.
   - Add 5 to their `attack`.
   - Print: `"[Name] leveled up! Health: [H], Attack: [A]"`
4. Use a `sum()` to calculate the **Total Attack Power** of the whole team after the level up.
5. Print: `"Team Total Power: [Total]"`

**Pro Tip:** This combines everything you've learned about lists, dictionaries, and loops! 🧠
