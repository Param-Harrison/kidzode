# Challenge: Boss Battle 🐉

## Your Mission
The Final Boss has appeared! 😱 It's a "Code Dragon" with 200 health. Your hero has 15 attack power. How many hits will it take to win?

## Your Task
1. Look at the `boss` dictionary.
2. Create a variable called `hits` and set it to `0`.
3. Use a `while loop` that runs as long as `boss["health"]` is greater than 0.
4. Inside the loop:
   - Subtract 15 from the boss health.
   - Add 1 to your `hits` counter.
   - Print: `"Hit #[hits]! Dragon health is now [health]"`
5. After the loop, print: `"Dragon defeated in [hits] hits!"`

**Goal:** Use the loop to automate the fight!
