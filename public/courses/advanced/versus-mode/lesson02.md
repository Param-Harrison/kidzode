# Fighting Logic 🗡️

Who wins a fight?
If `Attack > Defense`, it's a hit!

### The Logic
We compare one player's attack against the other's defense.

```python
if player1["atk"] > player2["def"]:
    print("Hit!")
else:
    print("Blocked!")
```

### Your Goal
1. Create two players with stats.
2. Check if Player 1 hits Player 2 (Atk > Def).
3. Print the result.

### Achievement
💻 **Combat Simulator**: You engineered the rules of war!
