# 🏆 CHALLENGE 2: Boss Battle
# ========================================

# The final boss approach!
boss = {"name": "Code Dragon", "health": 200}

# Your hero's stats
hero_attack = 15

# Your Mission: Find out how many hits it takes to defeat the boss.

# Step 1: Create a variable 'hits' and set it to 0
hits = 

# Step 2: Use a while loop that runs as long as boss["health"] > 0
while :
    # Step 3: Inside the loop, subtract hero_attack from boss["health"]
    
    
    # Step 4: Add 1 to your hits counter
    
    
    # Step 5: Print the progress
    print(f"Hit #{hits}! Dragon health is now {boss['health']}")

# Step 6: Print the final result after the loop
print(f"Dragon defeated in {hits} hits!")
