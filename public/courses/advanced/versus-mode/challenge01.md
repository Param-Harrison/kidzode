# Challenge: Hero Creator 🖌️

## Your Mission
Our game needs a "Character Creation" screen! 🎨 You need to build a dictionary from scratch based on what the player chooses.

## Your Task
1. Create a dictionary called `new_hero`.
2. Ask the user for their name using `input()`.
3. Set their `health` to 100.
4. Set their `class` to "Warrior".
5. Set their `strength` to a random number between 10 and 20.
6. Print: `"Welcome, [name] the [class]! Your strength is [strength]."`

**Hint:** Use `import random` and `random.randint(10, 20)` for the strength!
