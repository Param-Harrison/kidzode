# Challenge 2: Case Closed 📋

## Your Mission
The Chief of Police needs a full report on the investigation! 🏢 You need to show all the suspects we've found AND all the clues we've collected, plus the total count for each.

## Your Task
1. Create a list called `suspects` with at least 3 names.
2. Create a list called `clues` with at least 3 items.
3. Print: `"--- INVESTIGATION REPORT ---"`
4. Use `len()` to print how many suspects we have.
5. Use `len()` to print how many clues we found.
6. Print both lists so the Chief can see the data!

## Fun Goal
Try to make the report look professional, like a real digital detective's screen! 💻
