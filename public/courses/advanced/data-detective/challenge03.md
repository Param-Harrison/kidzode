# Challenge 3: Evidence Logger 📝

## Your Mission
New evidence is coming in every minute! 📞 We need a way to let other detectives type in a clue and have the computer **add it** to our backpack automatically.

## Your Task
1. Start with a list called `evidence` that is empty: `evidence = []`
2. Use `input()` to ask the user: `"What did you find?"`
3. Use a new magic command: `evidence.append(new_item)` to add it to your list!
4. Print the `evidence` list to show the new item is safely inside.

**Pro Tip:** `append` means "add to the end." It's like dropping a new item into your backpack! 🎒
