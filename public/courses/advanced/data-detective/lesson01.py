# ========================================
# 🕵️‍♂️ LESSON 1: The Suspect List
# ========================================

# A list is like a backpack - holds many items in one place!
# We use square brackets [] to create a list

suspects = ["The Fox", "The Bear", "The Cat"]

# Print the entire list
print("--- SUSPECT LIST ---")
print(suspects)

# Count how many suspects we have
print("Total suspects:", len(suspects))

# ----------------------------------------
# 🎮 TRY THIS:
# Add "The Owl" to the list and run again!
# suspects = ["The Fox", "The Bear", "The Cat", "The Owl"]
# ----------------------------------------
