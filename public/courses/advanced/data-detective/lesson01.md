# The Suspect List 📋

Welcome, Data Scientist! 🕵️‍♂️

In this course, you will learn how to handle **DATA** like a pro.
Your first case: A mystery has happened, and we have too many suspects to track!

### The Problem
If we use variables, it gets messy:
```python
suspect1 = "Mr. Green"
suspect2 = "Ms. Red"
suspect3 = "Dr. Blue"
```
What if we have 100 suspects? 😱

### The Solution: LISTS
A **List** is a special variable that can hold many things at once. It uses square brackets `[]`.

```python
suspects = ["Mr. Green", "Ms. Red", "Dr. Blue"]
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a list called `suspects` with 3 names.
2. Print the list to see your data!
3. Add an Achievement badge to your investigation log.

### Achievement
📦 **Data Collector**: You built your first dataset!
