# Examining Evidence 🔎

## Quick Reminder
You know how to store clues in a list and count them using `len()`. You're getting good at this! 🕵️‍♂️

## Your Mission
Storing all the clues is step one, but now we need to look at them one by one. To solve the crime, we need to grab the **first** clue, then the **second**, then the **third**. 

## The Zero Rule 0️⃣
Imagine our list is a line of suspects. Each suspect has a number on their jersey. But here's the catch: **Computers start counting at 0!**

| Position | What you call it | The Prize |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | Position 0 (The First!) | 🥇 |
| **1** | Position 1 (The Second) | 🥈 |
| **2** | Position 2 (The Third) | 🥉 |

## How to grab an item
To look at a specific item, we use square brackets with the number inside:
```python
suspects = ["The Butler", "The Chef", "The Driver"]

print(suspects[0])  # "Hey computer, show me the FIRST suspect!"
```

## Try It!
1. Look at the code. We have three main suspects.
2. Run the code to see who is at **Position 0**.
3. **Puzzle:** Can you change the code to print the suspect at **Position 2**? That's the third person in line!

## What You Learned
✅ Every item in a list has a position number.
✅ Computers start counting at **0**.
✅ Use `list[0]` to get the very first item.
