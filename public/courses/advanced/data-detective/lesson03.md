# Examining Evidence 🔎

A detective needs to look closer at specific clues.
In Python, every item in a list has a hidden number called an **Index**.

### The Zero Rule
Computers start counting at **0**, not 1!
- 1st item = Index 0
- 2nd item = Index 1
- 3rd item = Index 2

### How to use it
To get the first item:
```python
print(clues[0])
```

To get the second item:
```python
print(clues[1])
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a list of 3 suspects.
2. Print the **first** suspect (Index 0).
3. Print the **third** suspect (Index 2).
