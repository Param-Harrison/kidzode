# Counting Clues 🔢

A good detective knows exactly how much evidence they have.
In Python, we can count the number of items in a list using `len()` (short for length).

### The Tool: len()
If you have a list:
```python
clues = ["Footprint", "Fingerprint", "Note"]
```

You can count them like this:
```python
count = len(clues)
print(count)
# This prints 3
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a list called `clues` with 4 items.
2. Use `len(clues)` to count them.
3. Print: "Total Clues Found: [number]"

### Achievement
