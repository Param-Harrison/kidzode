# Our suspect list
suspects = ["The Butler", "The Gardner", "The Chef"]

# Access specific suspects by position
# Remember: positions start at 0!

print("Suspect at position 0:", suspects[0])  # First
print("Suspect at position 1:", suspects[1])  # Second
print("Suspect at position 2:", suspects[2])  # Third

print("")
print("The first suspect is:", suspects[0])
print("The last suspect is:", suspects[2])

# ----------------------------------------

# Change suspects[0] to suspects[1] and see who appears!
