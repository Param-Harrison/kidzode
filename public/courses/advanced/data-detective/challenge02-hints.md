# Hints for Case Closed

## 🟢 Hint 1
Square brackets work the same way, just put a negative number inside!
```python
last = evidence[-1]
```

## 🟡 Hint 2
Make sure you don't use a number that is too big (like `[-10]`) or it will crash!

## 🟠 Hint 3
Print them out clearly:
```python
print("Newest Evidence:", evidence[-1])
```
