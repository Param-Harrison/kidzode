# Win or Lose

When does the game end?
When health hits 0!

```python
health = 0

if health <= 0:
    print("You died! Game Over. 💀")
else:
    print("Still fighting! ⚔️")
```

You'll see:
```
You died! Game Over. 💀
```

Always check for Game Over!

## Try This!
Check if the ENEMY health is 0 to win!
