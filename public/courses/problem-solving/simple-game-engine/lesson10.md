# Multiple Players

A game needs friends (or enemies)!

```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

p1 = Player("Mario")
p2 = Player("Bowser")

print(f"{p1.name} VS {p2.name}")
```

You'll see:
```
Mario VS Bowser
```

We can create as many objects as we want from ONE class!

## Try This!
Create a list of 3 players!
