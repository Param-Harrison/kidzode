# Final Challenge: Password Strength Checker

Build a tool to test passwords!

1. Create a function `is_strong(password)`
2. It should check:
   - Length is at least 8
   - Contains "!" symbol (Hint: `if "!" in password:`)
3. Test it with different passwords!

```python
# Write your code here!

```

**Example Output:**
```
Testing 'hello': Weak ❌
Testing 'hello!': Weak ❌ (Too short)
Testing 'password123!': Strong ✅
```
