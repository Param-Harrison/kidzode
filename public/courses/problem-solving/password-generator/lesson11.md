# Introduction to Functions

Typing the same code over and over is boring.
Let's make a **Function**! It's like a custom command.

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello from a function!")

say_hello()
say_hello()
```

You'll see:
```
Hello from a function!
Hello from a function!
```

We defined `say_hello` once, and used it twice!

**How it works:**
- `def` defines the function name.
- The code inside (indented) runs when you call it `say_hello()`.

## Try This!
Make a function `say_bye()` that prints "Goodbye!"
