# The Ultimate Formula

Combine `sum()` and `len()` for the perfect average calculator!

```python
grades = [90, 80, 100, 85, 95]

average = sum(grades) / len(grades)

print(f"Average: {average}")
```

You'll see:
```
Average: 90.0
```

This code works for ANY list of numbers, big or small!

## Try This!
Make a list with 100 numbers (just kidding, maybe 10)!
