# Calculate Average

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of subjects.

We use `/` to divide.

```python
total = 170
count = 2

average = total / count
print(f"Average: {average}")
```

You'll see:
```
Average: 85.0
```

That's a B! Not bad!

## Try This!
Calculate the average of 3 scores: 90, 80, 100.
