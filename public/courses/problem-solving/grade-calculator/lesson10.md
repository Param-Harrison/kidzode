# Letter Grades

Pass/Fail is boring. We want A, B, C!

Use `elif` (else if) to check multiple things.

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")
else:
    print("C or lower")
```

You'll see:
```
B
```

It checks the first one (90?), then the next (80?)...

## Try This!
Change `score` to 95 to get an A!
