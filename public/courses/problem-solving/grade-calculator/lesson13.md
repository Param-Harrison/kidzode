# Weighted Average Code

Let's make a calculator for a hard class!
- Homework: 20% (0.2)
- Projects: 30% (0.3)
- Final Exam: 50% (0.5)

```python
hw = 90
proj = 80
exam = 70

grade = (hw * 0.2) + (proj * 0.3) + (exam * 0.5)
print(f"Weighted Grade: {grade}")
```

You'll see:
```
Weighted Grade: 77.0
```

The exam pulled the grade down! 📉
