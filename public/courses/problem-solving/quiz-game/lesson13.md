Let's organize questions by topic!

We can use a dictionary of lists!

```python
quiz_data = {
    "math": [{"q": "1+1", "a": "2"}],
    "science": [{"q": "H2O is?", "a": "Water"}]
}

print(quiz_data["science"][0]["q"])
```

You'll see:
```
H2O is?
```

Nested data structures are powerful!

## Try This!
Add a "history" category!
