# List of Dictionaries

Variables `q1`, `q2`, `q3` are messy.
Let's put them in a LIST!

```python
quiz = [
    {"q": "2+2?", "a": "4"},
    {"q": "3+3?", "a": "6"}
]

print(quiz[0]["q"])
```

You'll see:
```
2+2?
```

We accessed the first item `[0]`, then its key `["q"]`!

## Try This!
Print the answer to the second question!
