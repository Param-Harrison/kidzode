# Create a Dictionary

Let's store some info about a person.

```python
person = {
    "name": "Param",
    "age": 10,
    "city": "New York"
}

print(person)
```

You'll see:
```
{'name': 'Param', 'age': 10, 'city': 'New York'}
```

It's like a profile card!

**Rules:**
- Keys must be unique (can't have two "name"s)
- Use colons `:` between Key and Value
