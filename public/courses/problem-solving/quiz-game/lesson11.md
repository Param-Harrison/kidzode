# Multiple Choice

Typing answers is hard. Let's give options!

We can store options in a **List** inside our **Dictionary**!

```python
q = {
    "question": "Best fruit?",
    "options": ["A: Apple", "B: Banana", "C: Cherry"],
    "answer": "A"
}

print(q["question"])
print(q["options"])
```

You'll see:
```
Best fruit?
['A: Apple', 'B: Banana', 'C: Cherry']
```

Now the player just picks A, B, or C!

## Try This!
Add a 4th option "D: Durian"!
