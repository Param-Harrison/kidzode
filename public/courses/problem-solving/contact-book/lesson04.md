# List of Contacts

One friend is lonely. Let's have a party!

We can put dictionaries inside a list.

```python
contacts = [
    {"name": "Mario", "phone": "555-0123"},
    {"name": "Luigi", "phone": "555-0456"}
]

print(contacts[0]["name"])
```

You'll see:
```
Mario
```

`contacts[0]` gets the first dictionary.
`["name"]` gets the name from it.

## Try This!
Print Luigi's phone number!
