# Final Challenge: Organized Contacts

Group your contacts by category!

1. Create a dictionary `phonebook`
2. Keys should be "Family", "Friends", "Work"
3. Values should be **Lists of Dictionaries** (contacts)
4. Print only the "Friends" list nicely!

```python
# Write your code here!

```

**Example Output:**
```
--- FRIENDS ---
Name: Mario (Phone: 123)
Name: Luigi (Phone: 456)
```
