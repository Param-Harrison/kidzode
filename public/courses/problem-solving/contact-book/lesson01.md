# One Contact

Let's build a digital address book!

First, we need to store ONE friend.
A dictionary is perfect for this!

```python
friend = {
    "name": "Mario",
    "phone": "555-0123"
}

print(friend)
```

You'll see:
```
{'name': 'Mario', 'phone': '555-0123'}
```

We have a name and a number linked together!

## Try This!
Create a contact for "Luigi" with a different number!
