# Count Contacts

How many friends do we have?

Use `len()` on the list!

```python
contacts = [
    {"name": "Mario", "phone": "123"},
    {"name": "Luigi", "phone": "456"}
]

count = len(contacts)
print(f"You have {count} contacts.")
```

You'll see:
```
You have 2 contacts.
```

Simple and useful!

## Try This!
Add 3 more contacts and check the count!
