# Budget Alerts

Let's warn the user if they spend too much!

```python
budget = 100
spent = 95

if spent >= budget:
    print("STOP SPENDING! 🛑")
elif spent >= budget * 0.9:
    print("Warning: 90% used! ⚠️")
else:
    print("You are safe. 👍")
```

You'll see:
```
Warning: 90% used! ⚠️
```

Smart alerts save money!

## Try This!
Change `spent` to 50. What does it say?
