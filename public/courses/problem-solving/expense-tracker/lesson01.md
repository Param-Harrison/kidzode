# Track Your Money

Where does your allowance go? Let's track it!

We can store an expense as a dictionary.

```python
expense = {
    "item": "Ice Cream",
    "cost": 5.00,
    "category": "Food"
}

print(f"Spent ${expense['cost']} on {expense['item']}")
```

You'll see:
```
Spent $5.0 on Ice Cream
```

Now you know where your money went!

## Try This!
Create an expense for a "Video Game" that costs $50!
