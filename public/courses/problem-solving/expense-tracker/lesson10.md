# Remaining Budget

How much money is left?

```python
budget = 50
expenses = [10, 5, 20]
total_spent = sum(expenses)

remaining = budget - total_spent

print(f"Budget: ${budget}")
print(f"Spent: ${total_spent}")
print(f"Left: ${remaining}")
```

You'll see:
```
Left: $15
```

Now you know if you can buy that toy!

## Try This!
Spend more than $50. Does `remaining` go negative? Yes!
