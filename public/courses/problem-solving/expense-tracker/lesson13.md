# Monthly View

Let's organize by month!

```python
expenses = {
    "January": 50,
    "February": 30,
    "March": 100
}

for month in expenses:
    print(f"{month}: ${expenses[month]}")
```

You'll see:
```
January: $50
February: $30
March: $100
```

Seeing trends helps you plan!

## Try This!
Add "April" with $0 spending!
