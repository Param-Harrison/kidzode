# Mark as Complete

Did you finish your habit? Update it!

```python
habit = {
    "name": "Read Book",
    "completed": False
}

print("Reading book...")
habit["completed"] = True

if habit["completed"]:
    print("Good job! 📚")
else:
    print("Go read!")
```

You'll see:
```
Reading book...
Good job! 📚
```
