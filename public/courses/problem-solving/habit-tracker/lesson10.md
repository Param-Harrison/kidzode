# Percentage Complete

Let's get a score!

```python
completed = 5
total = 7

percent = (completed / total) * 100
# Round to 1 decimal place
percent = round(percent, 1) 

print(f"Success Rate: {percent}%")
```

You'll see:
```
Success Rate: 71.4%
```

Aim for 100%!

## Try This!
If you complete 7 out of 7, what is the percentage?
