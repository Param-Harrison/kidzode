# Current vs Best

Are you close to your record?

```python
current = 3
best = 5

if current == best:
    print("New Record! 🎉")
elif current > best:
    print("Unstoppable! 🚀")
else:
    left = best - current
    print(f"{left} days to beat your record!")
```

You'll see:
```
2 days to beat your record!
```

Motivation!

## Try This!
Set `current` to 5 to celebrate!
