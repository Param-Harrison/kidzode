# Find the Min

Who was the slowest? 🐢
Use `min()` to find the smallest number.

```python
times = [12.5, 10.2, 15.0]
fastest = min(times)

print(f"Fastest Time: {fastest} seconds")
```

You'll see:
```
Fastest Time: 10.2 seconds
```

Smaller is better for racing!

## Try This!
Find the lowest temperature in `temps = [30, 25, 40]`!
