# Sort Data

Organize your data!
Use `sorted()` to put numbers in order.

```python
scores = [50, 10, 30, 20]
ordered = sorted(scores)

print(f"Original: {scores}")
print(f"Ordered: {ordered}")
```

You'll see:
```
Ordered: [10, 20, 30, 50]
```

Smallest to biggest!

## Try This!
Sort `[5, 1, 9, 3]`!
