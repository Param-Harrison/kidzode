# Hello World! 🚀

Welcome to Python! The very first thing we learn in any language is how to say "Hello World".

In Python, we use the `print()` function to show things on the screen.

### Your Goal
1. Look at the code in the editor.
2. Click the **Run** button.
3. See the message "Hello, Kidzode Explorer!" in the terminal.

Try changing the message to say something else!
