# What's Your Name? 👋

Coding is not just about telling the computer what to do, but also asking it questions!

We use something called `input()` to ask the user a question.

### How it works
When you run the code:
1. A small box will pop up at the top of your browser.
2. Type your name in it.
3. Hit **Enter**.

### Your Goal
1. Run the code.
2. Enter your name when asked.
3. See how the computer says hello back to you!
