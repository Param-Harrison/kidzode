# Math Fun! 🧮

Computers are super fast at math. We can ask for numbers and do calculations!

Remember: Whenever we get a number from `input()`, we use `int()` to tell Python it's a "whole number".

### Your Goal
1. Run the code.
2. Enter two different numbers.
3. See how the computer adds them up instantly!
