# Welcome to Login Server! 🔐
Stop right there! Only authorized users can pass. Let's build a secure gatekeeping system that protects user accounts and passwords!

## The User Database 🗄️

Servers need to remember who is allowed in.
We use a **Dictionary** where:
- Key = Username
- Value = Password

### The Database
```python
db = {
  "admin": "1234",
  "guest": "pass"
}
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a `users` dictionary.
2. Add "alice" with password "wonderland".
3. Add "bob" with password "builder".
4. Print the database.

### Achievement
🗄️ **Database Admin**: You created a user storage system!
