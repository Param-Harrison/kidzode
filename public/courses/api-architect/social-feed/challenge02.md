# CHALLENGE 2: Spambot Filter 🤖

Users hate spam!
Let's hide posts that look fake.
Any post saying "Click Here" is spam.

### Your Task:
1. Create a `feed` list with some "Click Here" posts.
2. Create `clean_feed = []`.
3. Loop through `feed`.
4. If "Click Here" is NOT in the post, append to `clean_feed`.
5. Print `clean_feed`.
