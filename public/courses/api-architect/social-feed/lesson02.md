# Sorting by Likes (Logic) 📊

We want the most popular posts first.
This is called **Sorting**.
We can use logic to find the best one.

### The Logic
We will find the post with `max()` likes.
Or we can use `sorted()` (Advanced!).
For now, let's just loop and print high-likes posts only.

### Your Goal
1. Loop through `posts`.
2. check `if post["likes"] > 10`.
3. Print: "FEATURED POST: [text]".

### Achievement
📊 **Algorithm**: You curated the best content!
