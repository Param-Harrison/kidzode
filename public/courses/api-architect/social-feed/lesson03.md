# Filtering by Topic #️⃣

Apps use hashtags to show relevant posts.
This is **Filtering**.

### The Logic
```python
if "#tech" in post["content"]:
    # Show it
```

### Your Goal
1. Create posts with hashtags.
2. Create variable `topic = "#art"`.
3. Loop through feed.
4. If `topic` is in `post["text"]`, print it.

### Achievement
#️⃣ **Curator**: You organized the feed by interest!
