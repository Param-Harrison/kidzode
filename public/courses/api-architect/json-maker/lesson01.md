# Welcome to JSON Maker! 📄
In the world of the internet, JSON is the universal language that computers use to talk to each other. Let's learn how to write it like a pro!

## What is JSON? 📄

Computers use **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) to talk to each other.
It looks EXACTLY like a Python Dictionary!

### The Format
```python
user = {
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Coder1"
}
```

### Your Goal

2. Add `"username": "Dev"`.
3. Add `"online": True`.
4. Print the user.
