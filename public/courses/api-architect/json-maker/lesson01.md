# What is JSON? 📄

Computers use **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) to talk to each other.
It looks EXACTLY like a Python Dictionary!

### The Format
```python
user = {
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Coder1"
}
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a variable `user` with a dictionary.
2. Add `"username": "Dev"`.
3. Add `"online": True`.
4. Print the user.

### Achievement
📄 **JSON Architect**: You wrote your first data object!
