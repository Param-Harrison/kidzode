# Nested Data 📦

Real data is complex! We can put a Dictionary INSIDE a Dictionary.
This is called **Nesting**.

### The Structure
```python
profile = {
  "name": "Sam",
  "stats": {"wins": 5, "id": 99}
}
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a `player` dictionary.
2. Inside `player`, add a `location` dictionary with "x" and "y".
3. Print `player["location"]["x"]`.

### Achievement
📦 **Data Packer**: You stored data inside data!
