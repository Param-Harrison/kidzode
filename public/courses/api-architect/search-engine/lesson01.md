# Welcome to Search Engine! 🔍
Looking for a needle in a digital haystack? We're going to build a high-speed index like Google to find information in a flash!

## The Word Index 📖

Search engines don't read every page every time.
They cheat! They use an **Index**.
An index tells us which page a word is on.

### The Index
```python
index = {
  "apple": [1, 5], # apple is on page 1 and 5
  "banana": [2]
}
```

### Your Goal
1. Create an `index` dictionary.
2. Index "python" is on pages `[10, 20]`.
3. Index "code" is on page `[5]`.
4. Print the index.

### Achievement
📖 **Librarian**: You organized information for retrieval!
