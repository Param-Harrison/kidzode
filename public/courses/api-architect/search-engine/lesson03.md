# Building an Index 🏗️

Now let's build an index automatically.

### The Algorithm
1. Read a sentence.
2. Split into words.
3. For each word, add current page number to index.

### Your Goal
1. Create empty `index = {}`.
2. Create `words = ["hello", "world"]`.
3. Loop through words.
4. Set `index[word] = 1`. (Word is on page 1).
5. Print index.

### Achievement
🏗️ **Crawler**: You automated the indexing process!
