# The Response 💬

After a Request, the server sends a **Response**.
This is the answer!

### The Logic
We use `if/else` to decide what to say.

```python
if msg == "hello":
    response = "Hi there!"
else:
    response = "I don't understand."
```

### Your Goal
1. Create `msg = "ping"`.
2. Check `if msg == "ping"`.
3. If yes, set `response = "pong"`.
4. Print the response.

### Achievement
💬 **Responder**: You built a basic echo server!
