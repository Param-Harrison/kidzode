# The Request 📨

Computers talk in **Requests** and **Responses**.
A Request is just a message sent to the server.

### The Input
We simulate a request using `input()`.

```python
request = input("Send command: ")
print("Received:", request)
```

### Your Goal
1. Create a variable `msg`.
2. Ask the user: "What is your command?".
3. Print: "Server received: [msg]".

### Achievement
📨 **Messenger**: You sent your first API request!
