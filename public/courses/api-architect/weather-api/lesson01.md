## Welcome to Weather API! ☁️
Is it time for sunglasses or an umbrella? We're going to learn how to handle complex data from real-world weather stations all over the globe!

# The Complex Dictionary ☁️

Real APIs return **Huge Dictionaries** with lists inside them.
Look at this weather data!

### The Structure
```python
weather = {
  "city": "London",
  "forecast": [
    {"day": "Mon", "temp": 20},
    {"day": "Tue", "temp": 22}
  ]
}
```

### Your Goal
1. Create the `weather` dictionary above.
2. Print `weather["city"]`.
3. Print the whole `forecast` list.

### Achievement
☁️ **Data Analyst**: You modeled a complex API response!
