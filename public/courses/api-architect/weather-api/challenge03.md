# CHALLENGE 3: Forecast Analyzer 🔮

Let's find the **Hottest Day** in the forecast.
We need to combine `max()` logic with our loop.

### Your Task:
1. Create a `max_temp = 0`.
2. Create `hottest_day = ""`.
3. Loop through forecast.
4. If `temp > max_temp`, update both variables.
5. Print "Hottest day is [day] with [temp]".
