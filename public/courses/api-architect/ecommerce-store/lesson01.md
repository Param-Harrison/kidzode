# Welcome to Ecommerce Store! 🛍️
Ready to launch your own online shop? We're going to build the digital backbone that keeps track of products, prices, and shopping carts!

## The Product Database 📦

Stores have huge databases of products.
Each product has an ID, name, and price.

### The Structure
```python
shop = [
  {"id": 1, "name": "Apple", "price": 10},
  {"id": 2, "name": "Banana", "price": 5}
]
```

2. Add a product: `{"name": "Shirt", "pk": 101}`.
3. Add another: `{"name": "Hat", "pk": 102}`.
4. Print the cart.
