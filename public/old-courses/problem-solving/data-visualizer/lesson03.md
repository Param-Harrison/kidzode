# Calculate Average

What's the average score?
Formula: `Total / Count`

```python
scores = [10, 20, 30]

total = sum(scores)
count = len(scores)

average = total / count

print(f"Average: {average}")
```

You'll see:
```
Average: 20.0
```

It's the number in the middle!

## Try This!
Calculate the average of `[5, 5, 5]`. It should be 5!
