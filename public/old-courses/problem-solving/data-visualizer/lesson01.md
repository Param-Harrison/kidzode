# Find the Max

Who has the high score? 🏆
Use `max()` to find the biggest number in a list.

```python
scores = [10, 50, 80, 20]
highest = max(scores)

print(f"High Score: {highest}")
```

You'll see:
```
High Score: 80
```

Easy peasy!

## Try This!
Add a score of 100 to the list and see if it finds it!
