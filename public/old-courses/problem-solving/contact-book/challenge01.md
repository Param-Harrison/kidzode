# Mini-Challenge 1: My Squad

Create a contact list for your squad!

1. Create a list `squad`
2. Add 3 dictionaries (friends or family)
3. Each should have `name` and `role` (e.g., "Bestie", "Mom")
4. Print them all in a loop!

```python
# Write your code here!

```

Output:
```
Mom: Boss
Dad: Chef
Sis: Gamer
```
