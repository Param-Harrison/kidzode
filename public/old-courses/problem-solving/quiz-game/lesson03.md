# Get Values

How do we get just the name?

We use the key inside square brackets `[]`.

```python
person = {"name": "Param", "age": 10}

print(person["name"])
print(person["age"])
```

You'll see:
```
Param
10
```

It's like looking up a word!

## Try This!
Try to get a key that doesn't exist, like `person["food"]`. What happens?
