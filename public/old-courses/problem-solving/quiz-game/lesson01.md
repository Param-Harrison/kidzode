# What is a Dictionary?

Lists are great, but sometimes we need labels.

A **Dictionary** connects two things: a **Key** and a **Value**.
Like a real dictionary connects a Word and a Definition!

- Key: "Apple" -> Value: "A red fruit"
- Key: "Dog" -> Value: "A loyal pet"

In Python, we use curly braces `{}`.

```python
my_dict = {}
print(my_dict)
```

You'll see:
```
{}
```

It's empty, waiting for data!

## Try This!
Create an empty dictionary called `pokedex`!
