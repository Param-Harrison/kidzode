# What is a Streak?

A **Streak** is how many days in a row you did something.
Don't break the chain!

We can use a list of Booleans to represent days.
`[True, True, False, True]`

- Day 1: Yes
- Day 2: Yes
- Day 3: No (Streak broken!)
- Day 4: Yes

Let's store history!

```python
history = [True, True, False, True, True]
print(history)
```

## Try This!
Create a history for a week where you missed only one day!
