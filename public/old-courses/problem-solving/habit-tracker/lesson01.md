# Track a Habit

Do you brush your teeth every day? Let's track it!

We can use a dictionary with a **Boolean** (True/False).

```python
habit = {
    "name": "Brush Teeth",
    "completed": True
}

print(f"Did you {habit['name']}? {habit['completed']}")
```

You'll see:
```
Did you Brush Teeth? True
```

**True** means Yes, **False** means No.

## Try This!
Create a habit "Clean Room" and set it to `False` (be honest!).
