# Clean Up Spaces

Sometimes text has extra spaces. Yuck!
Use `.strip()` to clean the edges.

```python
messy = "   hello   "
clean = messy.strip()

print(f"'{messy}'")
print(f"'{clean}'")
```

You'll see:
```
'   hello   '
'hello'
```

Nice and tidy!

## Try This!
Clean up "  oops  " and print it!
