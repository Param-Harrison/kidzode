# Mini-Challenge 2: Food Finder

Find out how much you spent on snacks!

1. Create a list `expenses` with 5 items (some "Food", some "Other")
2. Use **List Comprehension** to get only "Food" items
3. Print the list of food items

```python
# Write your code here!

```

Output: `[{'item': 'Pizza', ...}, {'item': 'Apple', ...}]`
