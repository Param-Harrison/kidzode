# List of Expenses

One expense isn't enough. We buy lots of things!

```python
expenses = [
    {"item": "Burger", "cost": 10.00},
    {"item": "Movie", "cost": 15.00}
]

print(expenses[1]["item"])
```

You'll see:
```
Movie
```

A list of dictionaries is the best way to store data!

Add a 3rd expense to the list!
