# List of Letters

To make a password, we need ingredients: LETTERS!

We can type them all out in a list.

```python
letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
print(letters)
```

You'll see:
```
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

But typing "a" to "z" is boring...

**Pro Tip:** Python has a shortcut!
```python
import string
print(string.ascii_lowercase)
```

## Try This!
Import `string` and print `string.ascii_lowercase` to see the whole alphabet!
