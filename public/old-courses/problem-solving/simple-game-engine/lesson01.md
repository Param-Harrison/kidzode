# What is a Class?

Imagine a blueprint for a robot. 🤖
The blueprint isn't the robot, but it tells you how to build one.

In Python, a **Class** is the blueprint.
An **Object** is the robot you build from it.

```python
class Robot:
    pass # Empty blueprint

my_robot = Robot() # Build one!
print(my_robot)
```

You'll see something like `<__main__.Robot object...>`
That means it exists!

## Try This!
Create a class called `Spaceship` and build one!
