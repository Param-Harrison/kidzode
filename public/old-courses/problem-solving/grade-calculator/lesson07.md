# The Count Shortcut

Counting by hand is bad. What if the list changes?

Use `len()` to count for you!

```python
grades = [90, 80, 100, 85]
count = len(grades)

print(f"Number of grades: {count}")
```

You'll see:
```
Number of grades: 4
```

Now the computer does the work!

## Try This!
Add more grades. Does the count update automatically? Yes!
