# The Sum Shortcut

Loops are cool, but `sum()` is faster!

Python has a built-in function to add up a list.

```python
grades = [90, 80, 100]
total = sum(grades)

print(f"Total: {total}")
```

You'll see:
```
Total: 270
```

One line of code instead of a loop!

## Try This!
Use `sum()` on a list of prices: `[1.50, 2.99, 0.99]`
