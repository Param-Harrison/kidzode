# Pass or Fail?

We have the average. Did we pass?

Use `if` and `else` to decide!

```python
average = 55

if average >= 60:
    print("Pass! 🟢")
else:
    print("Fail! 🔴")
```

You'll see:
```
Fail! 🔴
```

Computers can be strict teachers!

## Try This!
Change `average` to 80 to see the green light!
