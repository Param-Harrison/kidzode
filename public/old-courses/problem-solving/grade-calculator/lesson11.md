# Average Function

Let's make a tool we can reuse!

A function that calculates the average of ANY list.

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

my_grades = [90, 80, 100]
print(calculate_average(my_grades))
```

You'll see:
```
90.0
```

**New Keyword:** `return` gives the answer back to you!

## Try This!
Create a list `friends_grades` and use the function on it!
