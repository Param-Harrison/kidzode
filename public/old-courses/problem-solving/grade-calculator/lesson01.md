# Adding Numbers

Let's build a calculator for school grades!

First, we need to do some math.

```python
math = 90
science = 80

total = math + science
print(f"Total Score: {total}")
```

You'll see:
```
Total Score: 170
```

Simple addition!

## Try This!
Add a third subject "History" with a score of 85!
