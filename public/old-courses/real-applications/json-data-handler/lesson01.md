# What is JSON?

**JSON** stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation.

It's a way to store data that computers understand. It looks almost exactly like a Python Dictionary!

Websites use JSON to send data to each other. For example, a weather app gets weather data as JSON.

```python
# This is a Python Comment
print("JSON is data for the web!")
```

You'll see:
```
JSON is data for the web!
```

## Try This!
Print "I love JSON!"
