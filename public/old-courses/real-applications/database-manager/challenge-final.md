# Final Challenge: Blog Engine 📝

You are building a blog! You have 2 tables: `users` and `posts`.

**Users:**
- 1: Alice
- 2: Bob

**Posts:**
- "Python Rocks" (by Alice)
- "My Cat" (by Bob)
- "Coding is Fun" (by Alice)

**Your Mission:**
1. Create the `users` and `posts` lists.
2. Loop through `posts`.
3. For each post, find the author's name from `users`.
4. Print: `[Author Name] wrote: [Post Content]`

Bonus: Using a Dictionary Index for users is faster! 🚀

Go build it!
