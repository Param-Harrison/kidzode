# Mini-Challenge 3: Smart Query

Here are the players:
```python
db = [
    {"name": "Mario", "coins": 10},
    {"name": "Luigi", "coins": 50},
    {"name": "Peach", "coins": 100},
    {"name": "Toad", "coins": 5}
]
```

**Your Goal:**
1. Filter: Get players with more than 20 coins.
2. Sort: Order them by coins (lowest to highest).
3. Print: Their names.

Go! 💰
