# Computer Memory 🧠

Your hard drive is not a bag of files. It's a **Tree**! 🌳

- **Root**: The start (/)
- **Folders**: Branches
- **Files**: Leaves

We can simulate this in Python using Objects!

```python
# A simple representation using Dictionaries
file_system = {
    "root": {
        "documents": {
            "homework.txt": "Math is fun",
            "photos": {}
        }
    }
}

print(file_system)
```

It's just boxes inside boxes!

## Try This!
Add a "music" folder inside "root"!
