# Loop Variable Power

Now use `i` to control the stars!

```python
symbol = "*"

for i in range(1, 6):
    print(symbol * i)
```

You'll see:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

A triangle! 📐

**How it works:**
- Loop 1: `i` is 1 -> prints `*`
- Loop 2: `i` is 2 -> prints `**`
- ...
- Loop 5: `i` is 5 -> prints `*****`

The pattern grows because `i` grows!

## Try This!
Make it grow to 10 lines!
