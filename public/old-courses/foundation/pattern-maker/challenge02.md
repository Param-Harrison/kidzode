# Mini-Challenge 2: Staircase Pattern

Build a staircase for a tiny robot!

1. Use a loop that runs 5 times
2. Inside the loop, print a growing pattern of blocks `[]`
3. It should look like steps!

```python
# Write your code here!

```

Output should look like:
```
[]
[][]
[][][]
[][][][]
[][][][][]
```
