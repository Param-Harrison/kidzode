# Print Statistics

Let's make a dashboard for our text!

```python
text = "Python is amazing"

print("--- TEXT STATS ---")
print(f"Characters: {len(text)}")
print(f"Words: {len(text.split())}")
print(f"Uppercase: {text.upper()}")
```

You'll see:
```
--- TEXT STATS ---
Characters: 17
Words: 3
Uppercase: PYTHON IS AMAZING
```
