# Loop Through Words

Since `.split()` gives us a list, we can loop through it!

```python
text = "Code is art"
words = text.split()

for word in words:
    print(word)
```

You'll see:
```
Code
is
art
```

One word per line!

**Why this is useful:** We can check each word individually!

## Try This!
Print each word in UPPERCASE inside the loop!
