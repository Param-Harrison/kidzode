# Fix Capitalization

What if the text is messy? "hElLo ThErE".

We can fix it!

```python
messy = "hElLo ThErE"
clean = messy.lower()

print(clean)
```

You'll see:
```
hello there
```

Much better!

**Pro Tip:** This is great for checking passwords so "Pass" and "pass" match!

Fix "PyThOn CoDiNg" to be all lowercase!
