# Find a Word

Let's find a specific word!

```python
text = "I like apples and bananas"
words = text.split()

if "apples" in words:
    print("Found apples! 🍎")
```

You'll see:
```
Found apples! 🍎
```

It searches the list for you!

**Note:** It must match exactly! "Apples" (capital A) is different from "apples".

## Try This!
Search for "bananas"!
