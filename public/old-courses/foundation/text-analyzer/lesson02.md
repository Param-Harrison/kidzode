# Analyze Variables

Let's analyze a variable!

```python
message = "Python is fun!"
count = len(message)

print(f"Length: {count}")
```

You'll see:
```
Length: 14
```

It counts the exclamation mark `!` too!

**Why this is useful:** Twitter uses this to check if your tweet is too long!

## Try This!
Change the message to a really long sentence!
