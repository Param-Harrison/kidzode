# Count Characters

How long is your name? Let's count!

We use `len()` (length) to count letters.

```python
print(len("Hello"))
```

You'll see:
```
5
```

H-e-l-l-o (5 letters).

**How it works:** `len()` counts every character, even spaces!

## Try This!
Count the length of "Super Coder"! (Hint: Space counts as 1!)
