# Replace Words

Change words like magic!

Use `.replace(old, new)`.

```python
text = "I like cats"
new_text = text.replace("cats", "dogs")

print(new_text)
```

You'll see:
```
I like dogs
```

It swaps them out!

**Note:** It replaces ALL of them!

## Try This!
Replace "sad" with "happy" in "I am sad today".
