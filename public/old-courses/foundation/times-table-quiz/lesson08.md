# Right or Wrong?

What if the answer is wrong? Use `else`!

```python
answer = 10

if answer == 12:
    print("Correct! ✅")
else:
    print("Wrong! ❌")
```

You'll see:
```
Wrong! ❌
```

Now your quiz can tell you if you messed up!

## Try This!
Change `answer` back to `12` to see the success message!
