# Check Answers

Let's start building the QUIZ!

We need to check if an answer is correct.

```python
answer = 12

if answer == 12:
    print("Correct! ✅")
```

You'll see:
```
Correct! ✅
```

**Important:**
- `=` sets a variable (put 12 in box)
- `==` checks if equal (is it 12?)

## Try This!
Change `answer` to `10`. Does it print anything?
