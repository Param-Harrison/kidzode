# Quiz Setup

Let's make a real quiz with multiple questions!

We need two lists:
1. The questions (math problems)
2. The correct answers

```python
questions = ["2 x 2", "3 x 3", "4 x 4"]
correct_answers = [4, 9, 16]

print("Quiz ready!")
```

We have our data! Now we need a player (YOU)!

## Try This!
Add "5 x 5" and `25` to the lists!
