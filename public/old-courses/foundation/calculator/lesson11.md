# Store Results in Variables

You can store calculation results and use them later!

```python
apples = 5
oranges = 3
total_fruit = apples + oranges

bananas = 4
grand_total = total_fruit + bananas

print(f"Total fruit: {grand_total}")
```

You'll see:
```
Total fruit: 12
```

Store results to use in more calculations!

## Try This!
Make a calculator that adds 3 numbers, then multiplies the result by 2!
