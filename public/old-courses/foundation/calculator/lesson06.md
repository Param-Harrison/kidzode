# Multiplication

Time to multiply! Use the `*` symbol:

```python
print(5 * 3)
```

You'll see:
```
15
```

The `*` means "times" - so `5 * 3` means "5 times 3"!

**How it works:** `5 * 3` = `5 + 5 + 5` = `15`

## Try This!
```python
price = 10
quantity = 4
total = price * quantity
print(total)
```
