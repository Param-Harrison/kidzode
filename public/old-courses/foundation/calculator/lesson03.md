# Store Numbers in Variables

Let's store numbers in variables, just like we did with text!

```python
first_number = 10
second_number = 5
```

Nothing prints yet - the computer just remembers both numbers!

**How it works:** Variables can hold numbers too, not just text!

## Try This!
Store your age and your friend's age in variables!
