# Add Two Numbers

Python can do math! Let's add numbers together.

Use the `+` symbol to add:

```python
print(5 + 3)
```

You'll see:
```
8
```

The computer did the math for you! Just like a calculator!

**How it works:** Python calculates `5 + 3` first, then prints the result.

## Try This!
- `print(10 + 7)`
- `print(100 + 25)`
