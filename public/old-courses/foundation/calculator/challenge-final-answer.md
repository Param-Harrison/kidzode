# Solution

```python
bill = 50.00
tip_percent = 0.18  # 18%
tip = bill * tip_percent
total = bill + tip

print("=" * 25)
print(f"Bill: ${bill}")
print(f"Tip (18%): ${tip}")
print(f"Total: ${total}")
print("=" * 25)
```

Output:
```
=========================
Bill: $50.0
Tip (18%): $9.0
Total: $59.0
=========================
```

**How it works:**
- Store bill amount
- Calculate tip (18% = 0.18)
