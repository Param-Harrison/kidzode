# Print the Variable

Let's see what's inside your variable!

Write the variable name (no quotes!) and Python uses what's inside.

```python
countdown = 10
print(countdown)
```

You'll see:
```
10
```

You used a variable! Store once, use many times!

**How it works:**
- Line 1: Store 10 in countdown
- Line 2: Print what's in countdown (which is 10!)

**Important:** `print(countdown)` prints the number. `print("countdown")` prints the word!

## Try This!
Print the same variable twice:
```python
countdown = 10
print(countdown)
print(countdown)
```
