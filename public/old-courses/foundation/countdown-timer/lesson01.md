# Print One Number

Welcome to coding! You're about to make the computer do what you tell it. Ready?

`print()` is like a megaphone. Whatever you put inside, the computer shouts it out!

```python
print(10)
```

Click Run ▶️ and watch!

You'll see:
```
10
```

You just wrote your first code! You're officially a programmer! 🎉

**How it works:** `print()` tells Python to show something, and `10` is what you want to show.

## Try This!
Change `10` to your favorite number!
