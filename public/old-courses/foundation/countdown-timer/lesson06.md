# Why We Need Loops

Imagine counting to 100. Would you write `print(1)`, `print(2)`... 100 times? NO WAY!

Look at this code:
```python
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
```

That's 5 lines to count to 5! What about counting to 1000? 😱

**Loops** let you repeat code automatically! Instead of 100 lines, you'll write just 2!
