# Store a Number

Time to learn **variables** - one of the most important coding concepts!

A **variable** is like a labeled box. Put something inside and find it later!

```python
countdown = 10
```

Click Run... nothing happens? That's okay! The computer stored it but didn't show it yet.

You just created your first variable! The computer remembers `countdown = 10`!

**How it works:**
- `countdown` = the box label
- `=` = put it in the box  
- `10` = what goes inside

**Note:** Variable names can't have spaces! Use `_` instead.

## Try This!
Try `my_age = 10` (use your real age!)
