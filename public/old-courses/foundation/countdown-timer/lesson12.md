Let's make it exciting with a blast off message!

```python
for number in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(number)
print("Blast off! 🚀")
```

You'll see:
```
10
9
...
1
Blast off! 🚀
```

Complete countdown timer! Like real rocket launches!

**How it works:** The second `print` is NOT indented, so it runs AFTER the loop finishes.

## Try This!
Add a message before: `print("Starting countdown...")`
