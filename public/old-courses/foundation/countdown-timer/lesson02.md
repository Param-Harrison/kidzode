# Print Multiple Numbers

Now let's print more than one number - the start of your countdown!

You can use `print()` as many times as you want! Each one shows on a new line.

```python
print(10)
print(9)
print(8)
```

You'll see:
```
10
9
8
```

You're counting down! Like timers on phones and microwaves!

**How it works:** Python runs your code top to bottom, one line at a time.

## Try This!
Add `print(7)` and `print(6)` to count down more!
