# Random Choice

Now let's pick a random fruit!

We use `random.choice()` to pick one item from a list.

```python
import random

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
picked = random.choice(fruits)

print(picked)
```

Click Run multiple times! You'll see different fruits!
```
apple
```
(Run again)
```
orange
```

It's like magic! The computer decides!

**How it works:** `random.choice(fruits)` picks one item from the `fruits` list.
