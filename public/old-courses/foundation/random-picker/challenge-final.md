# Final Challenge: Team Generator

Build a tool to pick teams for gym class or games!

1. Create a list of friends
2. Pick a random captain for **Team A**
3. Pick a random captain for **Team B**
4. Print both captains!

```python
# Write your code here!

```

**Bonus:** Make sure the same person isn't picked twice! (Hint: You might need to remove them from the list, or just run it until you get different names!)

## Try This!
Add a Team C captain too!
