# Pick Random Item

Let's make a "What should I play?" decider!

```python
import random

games = ["Tag", "Hide and Seek", "Hopscotch"]
print("Let's play:")
print(random.choice(games))
```

You'll see:
```
Let's play:
Hide and Seek
```

Never argue about what to play again! Let Python decide!

## Try This!
Change the games to your favorites!
