# Import Random Module

To pick random things, we need a special tool called `random`.

In Python, we "import" tools we need.

```python
import random

print("Random module loaded!")
```

You'll see:
```
Random module loaded!
```

Nothing fancy yet, but now we have the power of randomness!

**How it works:** `import random` tells Python "I want to use the random toolset".

## Try This!
Just run the code to make sure it works!
