# How Many Items?

Is our cart full? Let's count!

Use `len()` (short for length) to count items.

```python
cart = ["Apples", "Milk", "Bread", "Candy"]
count = len(cart)

print(f"You have {count} items.")
```

You'll see:
```
You have 4 items.
```

Computers count faster than us!

Add more items and see the number go up!
