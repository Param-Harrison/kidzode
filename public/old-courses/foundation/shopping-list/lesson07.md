# Remove Item

Changed your mind? Put it back on the shelf!

Use `.remove()` to take something out.

```python
cart = ["Apples", "Milk", "Broccoli"]
print(cart)

cart.remove("Broccoli")
print(cart)
```

You'll see:
```
['Apples', 'Milk', 'Broccoli']
['Apples', 'Milk']
```

Bye bye Broccoli! 🥦

**Note:** You must type the name EXACTLY right!

## Try This!
Try removing something that isn't in the list. What happens?
