# Make Borders

Create a full name tag with top and bottom borders!

```python
name = "Jack"
border = "*" * 15
print(border)
print("   " + name)
print(border)
```

You'll see:
```
***************
   Jack
***************
```

A real name tag! With borders and spacing!

**Tip:** The `"   "` adds spaces to center the name
