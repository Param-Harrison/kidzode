# Multiple String Variables

Let's store more than one piece of text!

```python
first_name = "Jack"
last_name = "Smith"
print(first_name)
print(last_name)
```

You'll see:
```
Jack
Smith
```

Multiple text variables! Each has its own box!

**Tip:** Use descriptive names like `first_name` not just `name1`
