# String Repetition with *

Repeat symbols easily!

Use `*` to repeat strings!

```python
border = "*" * 10
print(border)
```

You'll see:
```
**********
```

10 stars with one line! Much easier than typing them all!

**How it works:** `"*" * 10` means "repeat * ten times"

## Try This!
- `"=" * 20`
- `"Hi! " * 5`
- `"🌟" * 8`
